Our intelligence services have zero credibility re: telling the American people the truth about the ""threats"" on distant shores that the American public is supposed to fear.  Weapons of mass destruction.  Gulf of Tonkin.  The Northwoods documents.  

The CIA does not serve the American people.  It serves the U.S. military in particular and the Military Industrial Congressional Complex in general.  They serve the people who want America's military to be involved in conflicts all around the world.  They know that to get funding, they need to be able to point to a threat, that they now are trying to make Russia out to be a big threat to the American people.  The corruption we can see in the Russian government is certainly no better than the corruption we see in our own government, but seriously, a THREAT to us?  

It's amazing that so many Americans are quite ready to tell you that they don't trust politicians, that they don't trust ""the government', but when it comes to generals and admirals and the alarmist rhetoric of patriotic politicians, they suddenly lose their sense of caution and willingly sop up the dire warnings they are being fed.  In many ways, America is just like Germany in the 100 years that led up to the utter devastation of their people and their land.  They believed the patriotic appeals they heard and took pride in their military's achievements and the righteousness of the causes that were put before them by their most patriotic leaders.  And look where it got them.

The American people need to realize---as the German people finally did at the end of WWII---that the single greatest threat to a modern nation is not some country full of ""bad people' in distant lands, but is rather THEIR OWN MILITARY AND POLITICAL LEADERS.  ANY time that we hear emotional speeches being made in Washington re: some supposed ""threat"" facing the American people requiring a military response from us, our automatic, reflexive, rational response should be to view it with extreme cynicism, and with a full expectation that we are probably being lied to, or misled, JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN SO MANY TIMES PREVIOUSLY.

They'll call our suspicions ""conspiracy theories', but a sober understanding of recent history tells us that conspiring to fool the American people is something they do ALL THE TIME.

If that body be ignorant, reckless and corrupt, it is because the people tolerate ignorance, recklessness and corruption. If it be intelligent, brave and pure, it is because the people demand these high qualities to represent them in the national legislature‚Ä¶. If the next centennial does not find us a great nation ‚Ä¶ it will be because those who represent the enterprise, the culture, and the morality of the nation do not aid in controlling the political forces.

Our intelligence services have zero credibility re: telling the American people the truth about the ""threats"" on distant shores that the American public is supposed to fear.  Weapons of mass destruction.  Gulf of Tonkin.  The Northwoods documents.  And more...

The CIA does not serve the American people.  It serves the U.S. military in particular and the Military Industrial Congressional Complex in general.  They serve the people who want America's military to be involved in conflicts all around the world.  They know that to get funding, they need to be able to point to a threat, that they now are trying to make Russia out to be a big threat to the American people.  The corruption we can see in the Russian government is certainly no better than the corruption we see in our own government, but seriously, a THREAT to us?  

It's amazing that so many Americans are quite ready to tell you that they don't trust politicians, that they don't trust ""the government', but when it comes to generals and admirals and the alarmist rhetoric of patriotic politicians, they suddenly lose their sense of caution and willingly sop up the dire warnings they are being fed.  In many ways, America is just like Germany in the 100 years that led up to the utter devastation of their people and their land.  They believed the patriotic appeals they heard and took pride in their military's achievements and the righteousness of the causes that were put before them by their most patriotic leaders.  And look where it got them.

The American people need to realize---as the German people finally did at the end of WWII---that the single greatest threat to a modern nation is not some country full of ""bad people' in distant lands, but is rather THEIR OWN MILITARY AND POLITICAL LEADERS.  ANY time that we hear emotional speeches being made in Washington re: some supposed ""threat"" facing the American people requiring a military response from us, our automatic, reflexive, rational response should be to view it with extreme cynicism, and with a full expectation that we are probably being lied to, or misled, JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN SO MANY TIMES PREVIOUSLY.

From an historical perspective, there is actually nothing in this possibility that should give any normal American actual cause for alarm, given certain facts that most educated members of the political class really ought to be aware of.

The single most important morsel of truth that MSM sources are willfully ignoring is the fact that ALL governments around the world that are major players in international affairs have for quite some time been doing their utmost to perfect their abilities to both 1) hack into the secure sites of other countries and 2) protect themselves from the same.

It would indeed be utterly insane for them to not do so.

We know this.  We‚Äôve always known this.  Contrary to what is being presented to us, there is absolutely nothing in the basic allegations re: Russion hacking that are really shocking or outrageous in any way.

Consider the implicit claim that is being advanced---that the United States government would never do such a thing to another country, cuz we are not as evil as the people we are accusing...

The actual historical truth of the matter is that the United States has a long history of using the CIA to do just that if/when our ‚Äòdecision-makers‚Äô perceived it would be in America's interests to do so:

In 1948, the United States propped up Italy's centrist Christian Democrats and helped ensure their electoral victory against a leftist coalition, anchored by one of the most powerful communist parties in Europe. CIA operatives gave millions of dollars to their Italian allies and helped orchestrate what was then an unprecedented, clandestine propaganda campaign: This included forging documents to besmirch communist leaders via fabricated sex scandals, starting a mass letter-writing campaign from Italian Americans to their compatriots, and spreading hysteria about a Russian takeover and the undermining of the Catholic Church.

Our political leaders have consistently shown that they are not above doing such things. Our leadership class has a long history of not only fomenting political revolutions/insurrections in other nations, but also of attempting to arrange the assassination of the leaders of other countries when we thought it would be in our interests to do so.

Given these indisputable facts re: our political history, it is indeed profoundly hypocritical for American politicians to now declare that efforts by other countries to do the same thing to us are both outrageous and alarming and maybe even acts of war.

The ultimate truth is that since forever all nations have always tried to influence the outcome of elections in other countries if 1) they believe their vital interests are at stake, and 2) they have the means to do so.

The only thing that has changed over the past 40 years is that the ""means to interfere"" available to technologically advanced nations has changed.  Back in the day, it usually involved getting spies/agents in the target country and then finding ways to get money to the political opposition in ways that are not obvious.  

Now---with the institutionalization of The Internet---the methods of 'influencing' are different.  Hacking foreign websites is more cost-efficient than the methods used in the old days to gather intelligence and 'influence' political developments in other countries.

So in light of these historical facts, the great momentous issue that is supposedly generating a great deal of alarm in Washington---the possibility that Russia might have tried to influence the outcome of our elections---is not any kind of news that can be rationally considered shocking or even scary.

It is not unexpected.  It does not present a threat to the American people.  And it is certainly not even remotely serious enough of a matter to actually risk going to war over.

Sure, if the Russians (or the Israelis, or any other country for that matter) had sent a team of assassins to kill one of our candidates, that would be quite a different matter entirely, but this 'revealing of political secrets' accusation doesn‚Äôt rise to anywhere near that level of seriousness.

No, my friend, we Americans do not have any right to insist that other countries forswear methods of interference that we ourselves have been guilty of with respect to other countries.

And thus, there is no rational basis for any of these expressions of outrage that are still being voiced re ‚ÄúRussian interference‚Äù a year after the allegations were first being headlined by the MSM.",1,/Negative/,Negative,0.561
