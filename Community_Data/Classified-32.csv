No, just amazed by your ignorance.  There is a difference.

""The last few hundred years have been progressing, but there's still remnants of a patriarchal world. ""
okay, then prove.   Again, answer my question.  Name a law, regulation, benefit, or privileged that favors a man over a woman.  Again I named several that favor women with the two biggest ones:

1. Women do not have to register for selective service
2. It is a woman's choice, but a man's responsibility.

""Just because YOU feel like the world has always been this equal doesn't make it true""
Strawman and red herring argument. You are changing the context of the conversation and arguing that point while trying to divert from the fundamental question I asked.  
 How you were treated in the 1900's before the 14th & 19th amendment is not relevant to today.   Those wrongs were corrected.  What else do you want people to do?  Bow to you and throw rose pedals every time you walk by?

""Dark Dextra Hi woman. What you think and feel are irrelevant. ""
How ironic, every hear of the 1st and 14th amendments?  +Dark is allowed to express her opinion as much as you are allowed to express yours.  However your personal beliefs, however misguided as they are can not be made into law to oppress anyone else.  In fact people like you I think miss the last line in the 14th amendment about equality under the law.

""Patriarchies have been common place throughout human history. ""
Yeah and....You still DO NOT live in one in the USA, Europe, parts of Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Canada, and actually MOST of the world.   Those societies typically exist where religion plays a key factor in their laws, hence +dark's comment on the middle east.  Again we have the 1st amendment which is supposed to prevent that from happening.

""That was my entire point, if feminists are trying to dismantle the patriarchy then they should also quit wearing makeup. ""

My wife does not wear make-up, never has and she never really will.  She puts on skin cream but that is about it.   Many women put on make-up because it builds confidence.   The same reason why I wear a suit to important meetings and interviews.

There is NOTHING wrong with presenting yourself appealing to your audience and taking pride in the way you look when you walk down the street.  No one is forcing any female to wear make-up.

But this does not increase attractiveness. Attractiveness relies on how feminine a girl's facial features are. Example of feminine features are high cheekbones that go out, small nose, wide but narrow eyes.

The reason why there are girls who are unattractive is because they inherited most of their face from their past fathers and grandfathers.

Consider what the general wave was all the time, men first encouraged the make up on women, in earlier times, men put on make up to distinguish between who is noble who is not. (Obviously the rich are the ones with make up) 

That trend continues in the form of filters and today's reality-adjacent instagrams where everyone looks like a Photoshop unicorn . 

Women call it sexist because it does an unusual if not untruthful representation of them without make up, but it is not sexist if you think you are literally being chosen to represent the anti-male presentation of what   ideal women look like (with make up). If you still look like as close to your real self and of close If you cared at all to begin with - then stay that way, be proud, but not call it sexist, it hasn't touched that at all. In fact, ridiculing the app maker for all the trolling not done by him, ridiculing for how he must be desperate to see what's underneath the filters, IS SEXIST. 

WHAT? A DESPERATE MAN DOES NOT DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING INTO BEFORE A RELATIONSHIP? No, don't perpetuate that thinking, that somehow anything done against women in social media is victimization, it is not always like that. Definitely don't ridicule the fact that as humans, our senses represent most of what we SEE, so if you don't see, don't blame someone for inventing an xray.

The guys who obsess about what women look like without makeup are usually undesirables who will only have a relationship with the woman they are focusing about in their imagination. 

It's very entitled (and delusional) for a man to think that a woman who doesn't even now he's alive is actually wearing makeup for  him. 

I think that mindset is as funny as heck. What do most men even know about makeup? Generally speaking, women wear makeup for other women. We admire, criticize, and copy each other.
