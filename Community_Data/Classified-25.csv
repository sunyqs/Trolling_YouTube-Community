It will, but it's so minuscule that you're not really making a viable case. You're undermining your credibility.

The fact is greenhouse gases travel everywhere and this leads to global warming and the acidification of the oceans.

On the local front, the people need to regulate to largely protect themselves.

I'd say it breaks down as follows. Locally, the USA gets about a C minus. Globally, due to the shear amount of greenhouse gases we release compared to others, we get an F.

I'm not confused. You are. When West Virginia dumps lead in the water I am most likely not going to get cancer from this activity. I'm 3 states. away. The West Virginians are at a much higher risk of getting caner.

When they burn coal, I will also not get lung cancer due to this activity. The locals near the plant are remarkably more at risk from the concentration of toxins they breathe. But the CO2 they release reaches an equilibrium in the atmosphere. It's not toxic to me or them, but the effects of global warming are just that, a global problem.

You're confusing toxins with greenhouse gases. One is a global problem while the other is largely a local health problem.

This is basic, but you're too enamored with the fact that air and water molecules move about the entire Earth. This is clouding your judgement.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.881

The EPA is not there to start businesses, what the hell is wrong with you?, the EPA is there to create regulations to ensure that the businesses don't further harm the environment.
The role of the government is not to invent solar energy or the smartphones, it is to make sure that people is not negatively affected by the production of a certain product or service.

No one needs to be an expert to make that obvious statement, and it is a farily innocuous and uncontroversial thing to say. 
The biggest problem India faces with pollution, air and otherwise, is that it is such a sprawling de-centralised population, there is so much infrastructure needed, and much of the pollution is produced not by large scale factories and energy producers, but by people in their homes. Much of the air pollution referred to in this article is being produced by home cooking fires, and by farmers burning away grass in their fields. It is difficult to solve such problems, but there are solutions, such as cheap, more efficient cooking stoves that can be produced locally from recycled material, and local recycling programs that incentivise people to collect rubbish and keep it out of the water systems.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.627

 The whole point of setting factories up in these countries is the lower cost.

Jay Electronica dated Kate Rothschild and resided in London for a period of time where he was trained by the British Knights Templar Freemasons in advanced Solomon witchcraft and mind control. Jay Electronica is an admitted member of the Five Percenters and Nation of Islam which are both Islamic-Black supremacist groups. Jay Electronica changed his name from Timothy Elpardo Thedford to Elpadaro F. Electronica Allah. Jay Electronica is signed to Jay Z's Roc-Nation and uses the name Jay for Jay Z who is also a member of the Nation of Islam and a top boss of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation. Jay Electronica is a Muslim, member of the Nation of Islam, and has connections with the Rothschild family. The French Rothschild family are intermarried with the Aldobrandini family of Rome. The name Aldobrandini derives from the Arabic word Aldebaran and they have an Arabic ancestry from the Moorish invasion. The Moors invaded Europe and were involved in the sex trafficking of European women. The Black Nobility of Rome, the Rothschild family, and House of Saud are all working together and directing and financing various secret societies, organized crime, and supremacist groups.

Some agents of the Five Percent Nation and Nation of Islam also include members of Wu-Tang like RZA, Nas, and Meek Mill. RZA is a very high level member of the AVLN. Jay Electronica has been teaching other rappers and members of these groups the more advanced mind control techniques he has learned while in London. Jay Electronica who thinks he is Allah is extremely murderous and destructive. They are involved in satanic sexual ritual abuse and mind control and they specifically target white women. They are also involved in murder, persecution, and organized crme. The Nation of Islam is ran by the millionaire Louis Farrakhan who is an FBI COINTELRPO agent part of the FBI's Project Megiddo. Members of black supremacist groups and Islamic supremacist groups are also being financed to spread racial division as a form of divide and conquer. Mid Eastern billionaires funnel their wealth through Mid East banks based in Geneva, Switzerland where bank accounts are private like Arab Bank, NBAD Private Bank, NBK Bank, and QNB Bank and then use US based investment companies like BlackRock Investment to mask transactions through foreign shell companies. There is no one to investigate the Arab billionaires who rule their own nations and that is why they are used for money laundering and making these illegal payoffs.
