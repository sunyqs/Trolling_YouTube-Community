""the OP is arguing under the presumption that a burdensome safety law won't work and thus should not be implemented.""  Just like all laws are burdensome and don't work--criminals break them while the law-abiding do not.
""Saying ""all laws"" starts a false comparison fallacy""  Just like saying ""all gun laws"" starts a false comparison fallacy vs specific ones.

""Seatbelt laws are enforced because you're statistically safer,""  Countries with comprehensive gun laws are statistically safer.

""Things like homicide are outlawed because its morally wrong""  Homicide refers to 'unlawful' killing.  If it is the 'killing' that is immoral, then killing with guns as self-defense is immoral.  If it is the 'unlawful' aspect that is immoral, repealing homicide laws corrects that.
"" If gun laws don't actually stop what they're supposed to do""  Gun proliferation doesn't actually do what its supposed to.

""and infringe on people's rights""  Laws infringe on people's 'rights'.  Repeal all laws and everyone has the right to do as they choose.

Yeah, because in 1986 they put a law in place that banned the sale of new ones and legally keeping a grandfathered one required registration, extensive background checks, an approval signature from a chief law enforcement official, a $200 tax stamp, and filing a request for approval with the ATF if you ever wanted to sell it to someone else.  Which all adds up to a waiting period of anywhere from 3 to 12 months to obtain one, on top of all the paperwork necessary to obtain it in the first place.

Apparently that was because the legislation itself (which was written in the 1930s, so, make of that what you will) specified that any part used to convert a weapon into a machinegun was a machinegun in and of itself.  ie it defined ""machinegun"" to include ""any part designed and intended solely and exclusively...for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun.""  The shoelace in question most certainly was designed and intended that way; the stupidity was in the law being written such that a single part could be classified as a machinegun on its own, before being added to the weapon.

Anyway even if you do classify oil as a ""device"", it does not ""attach"" to a firearm (if it can't *de*tach then it can't be *a*ttached), and it does not ""modify"" the firearm - an oiled rifle is still performing its function as intended by the manufacturer.  And further still, even if you assume it does ""modify"" a firearm, it is not used with the intent to increase the firearm's rate of discharge, it's used with intent to reduce wear on the internal mechanisms of the firearm.

There are no small arms which are outright banned federally.  There are just very strict rules about who's allowed to own or purchase one, and it's mostly just a lot of paperwork and an extra tax.

Even if everyone in the government woke up tomorrow and decided to make all semi-automatic rifles subject to the same regulations as machineguns, you would not suddenly be a criminal for owning whatever ones you own.  Because - shock - the supreme court upheld your 5th amendment right against self-incrimination after someone was charged with possession of an unregistered machinegun when he went to register the one he already owned.  This resulted in the law being amended to remove the requirement for possessors of unregistered firearms to register them, and added a provision stating that any information disclosed on an NFA application/registration cannot be used against you as evidence for being in violation of the law prior to filing the form.  In other words, if you owned an unregistered Tommy gun for 40 years and then decided to register it because you wanted to sell it legally, you could not be charged with unlawful possession of a machinegun based on admitting you owned one via filing your forms.  Guess what, the 2nd amendment isn't the only right used to protect other rights.  In addition to the 5th you'd also be protected under the 4th - unreasonable search and seizure.

> For example it is federally illegal to keep a registry yet we have state registries depending on state and of course a federal registry of firearms due to the NFA.

It's illegal to keep a universal federal registry, it's not federally illegal to keep a registry.  There's a difference.  The first makes it illegal for the federal government to keep a national registry, the second makes it illegal for anyone to keep a registry.  States are allowed to have their own registries.

Also the law that prevents establishing a federal registry specifies that it only applies to regulations enacted after the date the law goes into effect.  Any registry legally established before that law is exempted, including the NFA registry.  So no, the government is not breaking its own laws there.

> TYT claiming that there is no regulation on firearms when we do have significant gun controls and they don't work - it is just less than other countries.

1: We have less gun control than other countries
2: Countries with more gun control than us have less gun violence than we do
Yeah, clearly gun control doesn't work.

The NFA is grandfathered in as any registry law prior to this is legal if there was an attempt to have a registry any time after 1968 then yes it would be FEDERALLY illegal to do so many states are in violation.

Is that so?  The U.S. is the least regulated country on the planet correct?  Yet we rank number 11 and 18 in firearms deaths in total and deaths as rate.  All 10 and/or 17 countries with more firearms deaths have more regulations compared to the U.S.  So no that is absolutely false and a lie.

UgzlGXuwiJuYJC0kOPd4AaABAg,beer man,3 weeks ago,1511770250024,"RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE, Calif. — The shooting is over in Rancho Tehama, but the nightmare continues for Troy McFadyen.
He still vividly remembers the shooter running him off the road, methodically killing his wife, Michelle, shooting him twice and leaving them both in a ditch by the side of the road.
“I’m still having moments of flashbacks thinking about that truck coming toward me, just missing me,” McFadyen said. “And being shot and watching my wife.”

McFadyen was in Mercy Medical Center in Redding on Sunday recovering from his wounds, shot once in each leg. Both bones in his lower right leg were shattered by a bullet fired by Kevin Janson Neal.
McFadyen was one of 17 people Neal shot last Tuesday, according to the Tehama County Sheriff’s Office. Neal killed four people and wounded 13 others before he, too, was shot and killed by deputies.
The day before the shooting the 44-year-old Neal killed his wife and stuffed her under the floor of their Rancho Tehama home, officials said.
On Sunday, McFadyen was in his hospital room with visitors, including a brother, two sisters and a friend.
He wondered how it all could have happened, and why someone who was not supposed to have firearms shot and wounded him and gunned down his wife in the small rural community 15 miles southwest of Red Bluff.
“You know it’s a problem when I can’t just drive into town without getting shot,” he said.
McFadyen said he and his wife were driving out of town Tuesday morning for a doctor’s appointment when they saw a white pickup coming down the road toward them. The driver crossed into the oncoming lane, as if to crash head-on into the McFadyens.
Troy said he crossed over into the oncoming lane to avoid the truck, but it mirrored his maneuver.
As the truck got near, he swerved back over and the pickup hit his Ford Crown Victoria just behind the driver’s door, T-boning it.
The crash spun them around, but sent the truck crashing down an embankment and through a fence. He wasn’t able to open his door to get out of the car, so he and his wife got out through the passenger side.
“Just as I got outside of the vehicle the gunfire started, from the nearest we could tell it was down the hill, (from) this truck that just went in the gully,” he said.
“I look over my car, (over the roof) and look down the hill and this guy is drawing a bead with his pistol … He starts firing in our direction and I say to my wife ‘Run! Run! Let’s go!’” he said.
“We’re panicked and the gunfire is just coming, he’s coming up the hill, firing his gun,” he said.
McFadyen and his wife became separated. She fell in a ditch, while he headed up Stagecoach Road on foot.
He looked up and saw the man firing at him. One of the bullets hit his left leg and went through his thigh.
The shot stung, but he could still walk. A car drove by and McFadyen tried to get them to let him in, but they locked their doors and drove off, he said.
As McFadyen ran, Neal shot him in the right lower leg, shattering bones.
He fell in the road and tried to sit up. At that point, Michelle McFadyen came up the road toward him and Neal began firing at her.
“She becomes his new focus, I guess. She falls in the ditch and he walks up rather casually and puts two rounds in her. All the while I’m screaming, ‘Please don’t! Please don’t!’” McFadyen said.
After shooting his wife, he turned toward McFadyen. Michelle made a noise, so he turned back and shot her at least two more times, he said.
“So after he shoots her a second time he turns around and starts coming toward me again. At which point I lay back on my back and I say ‘I’m dead! I’m dead! I’m dead!'” McFadyen said.
He remembers looking the man in the eye as he came toward him. McFadyen had never seen him before, but he remembers seeing his pickup.
“He was calm, methodical,” he said. “I looked at him right in the face, just another creepo.”
He appeared to lose interest and walked back down the road and got into a gray car. McFadyen said he wasn’t sure where the gray car came from.
Neal drove up the road in the gray car toward McFadden as if he was going to run him over. McFadyen, however, was able to pull himself off the road and down into the ditch near his wife.
Neal drove off out of sight. The gunman's next stop was the Rancho Tehama Elementary School, according to the sheriff's office.
“We’re finally left alone, and I’m screaming for somebody to help because it seemed like I could have been on the moon,” he said.
After a few minutes, Christopher Bradford, the attendant at the nearby garbage transfer station, came to his aid. Bradford stayed with McFadyen until law enforcement arrived and drove him in his garbage truck to where paramedics could help him.
“Everyone else drove off, but not Chris. He’s a hero,” said Troy’s brother, Mike McFadyen. “Probably the only hero out there, and he works at the dump.”
Troy McFadyen estimated he was in the ditch waiting for help for about two hours. He was eventually flown out and taken to Mercy Medical Center.
He isn’t sure if he will be released from the hospital before Thanksgiving. And even after his release, he expects months of rehabilitation on his leg.
But he will be learning to walk again without his wife. Sunday he became angry thinking about how she was killed for no apparent reason by a stranger.
Before going to work in social services for Shasta County, she was a teacher who worked many years to help children. Troy McFadyen said he often worried about his wife working in downtown Redding.
“I talked to my wife a couple times a day because we really loved each other, and I always ended my calls with ‘Be safe,’” he said.
Concealed carry would have prevented this from happening. CRIMINALS DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAW PERIOD. Here in Idaho people are allowed to conceal carry without a permit and we are more safe from all this BS shootings that are happening in places like this. I sincerely hope that all you snowflakes out there open your eyes to the real problem that passing more gun control laws on law abiding citizens will never work because criminals will never follow your laws, which will leave us unprotected from them.

""shouldnt have laws against homicide because criminals will never follow those laws"" = false comparison fallacy. By most premises homicide is inherently immoral where as gun ownership is not.Gun laws are under the premise that they're just intended to protect where as homicide laws are as much about punishment, again for something inherently wrong  
.Assuming op is correct, laws that fail to protect from the dangers of something inherently neutral aren't worth burdening peaceful  law abiding citizens with. Legalizing homicide on the other hand completely contradicts that ""peaceful"" part to begin with. OP believes guns make us safer, homicide inherently  doesn't.

""I do want a heavy restriction on all guns, on the same level as Australia or Japan; two major gun control success stories.""

Australia has only accounted for 1/3 of prohibited firearms on their national registry which means 2/3 of prohibited firearms are in private hands more than a decade after those gun controls.  Gun homicide and homicide by any method is down as is gun homicide and total homicide in America.  Also this country is basically an ISLAND with a people based on collectivist nature not based on the individual.

Japan firearms or the wearing of weapons have been long restricted and mainly banned hundreds of years ago when Samurai were no longer allowed to even wear swords let alone firearms even during the age of black powder.  Even then their homicide rates have spiked and busted over the decades even when firearms of many different type were allowed under licensing and included semi auto. Same story as a basic type of people - collectivist in nature and an ISLAND.

I know what you will say, well Sweden or France has done a successful gun control system but those countries were not based on a second amendment type system and thus had less guns throughout that nations history. Thus leading to less guns in total. America has more guns than civilians, so if you even wanted to take away guns, it would not work for that reason. People will also manufacture them illegally as well. And for that I support very little gun control. Many of these anti gun supporters or even anti assault rifle supporters state that they want drugs to be legalized because people will get them anyway but the same thing can be said for guns. Finally one would say let's have a gun turn in/trade system. Well some Americans would turn in their guns but the majority would not because they don't want a government that can't be limited by the people and a government in which that the people fear or tyranny. These people want a government that can be limited by the people and that the government fears the people or Liberty. This is why gun control should not be strict. We have a duty to make sure that the government is not powerful enough for the people to fear. Limiting or banning assault rifles is giving the government that power to become tyrannical.

Suicide rates, and to some extent homicide rates, have gone down, saving many, many lives: http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/the-rate-of-all-suicides-and-homicides-in-australia-has-declined-since-the-gun-buyback-20160622-gpp4wp.html

Being an island has little to do with anything. Plenty of non-island countries have implemented gun control. Yes, countries like Japan place a focus on the well-being of society as a whole, and there's no reason the US can't do the same. If you're arguing we're unlikely to do this in the near future because we're selfish pricks (""individualists""), sure. But we can and should change.

Lastly, you're imagining some scenario where gun control is implemented by a mechanized Robama overlord. But we're talking about implementing it with the will of the people, this isn't going to start a civil war. Minds can be changed over time. Although I'll take a guess that the real issue isn't about how easily this can be accomplished, but simply that you don't think minds should be changed on this issue, because you think guns are somehow a good thing. They're not. We have 75,000 gun injuries per year, 21,000 suicides, and 11,000 homicides.

The actual number of people who own guns is, by one estimate, around 37%: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/04/a-minority-of-americans-own-guns-but-just-how-many-is-unclear/ People are not manufacturing them illegally in great quantities in Australia or Japan, so there is no evidence to think this would have to happen here.

Australia's gun buyback bought 660,000 firearms; a US one, dealing with a much bigger population, could potentially get more if it were seriously pursued. Perhaps we wouldn't get any from the fanatical super-owners, but we could potentially buy back the guns from people who only own one or two, knocking that 37% down a peg. That would be only one facet of gun control. Other facets would include mandatory safety classes, a really long cooling off period after purchase, proper gun storage and police inspection at times, licensing systems, etc.

The drug/gun comparison isn't valid. People truly crave drugs and have a biological need for them. But as countries like Japan, Australia, the UK, etc, have shown, people don't have an addiction to own guns; large black markets haven't formed like they did for alcohol during Prohibition.

Japan, Australia, the UK, etc, haven't become any more tyrannical than they already were. So there seems to be no correlation between gun control and 'tyranny level'.",3,/Negative/,Negative,0.67

Do some research on American gun law before making a jackass comment on youtube about something you have no idea about.

If people don't bother with ""scant regulation"" or ""record keeping"" it is because of federal law PROHIBITING a national registry on firearms that has been there for hundreds of years - despite the fact that the federal government is in violation of that same law when it comes to NFA controlled firearms and devices.

""Person-to-person"" resale is a private sale and NFA controlled firearms are not able to be sold in this way regardless if it is happening at a gun show or not.  FFLs even at gunshows are required to perform background checks in every state on every gun they sell.  ""No regulation"" and your claims just tells me you haven't purchased a firearm before and again have no idea what you are talking about.

Guess what we have 3d printers now so attempting to limit production isn't going to get you anywhere on top of the fact that radical constitutionalists would shoot and be shot if anything remotely next to confiscation were to occur to limit existing numbers of private firearms.",3,/Negative/,Negative,0.861

You are saying that buying a firearms should involve a waiting period then?  More artificial cost by government thrown in so you can't afford it?  Have the government give you a rectal exam?

If we are arguing over ideas then at least say specifics and consider logistics.  Try not to play the guessing game when it comes to trying to assume your or my position politically.

The FBI UCR lists firearm homicide by shotgun to be lower than that of fatal beatings almost by a factor of ~3.  The same statistics for any rifle which includes AR-15s.

The idea I was getting at was that laws which are unconstitutional can exist, and people will be bound by those laws and prosecuted under those laws just the same as any other, until the law's constitutionality is challenged and decided in court.  Even then, that decision only applies within that court's jurisdiction, so a law declared unconstitutional by one circuit can be declared constitutional by another one.  Those conflicting rulings would stand until the law went up to the SCOTUS for a final, nationwide decision.

A fairly recent example: in 2014, several different circuits, including the 9th, had ruled same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, but the 6th decided they were constitutional.  So it was illegal to ban same-sex marriage in Oregon, but legal to ban it in Ohio, due to the courts having differing interpretations of the constitution.  It wasn't until the constitutionality got determined by the SCOTUS that such bans became illegal nationwide.

That's what I meant by saying unconstitutional doesn't mean illegal.  A law can be unconstitutional and illegal in one state but constitutional and legal in another state; a law doesn't actually become illegal to enforce nationwide until the Supreme Court says so.  Until then, it may be unconstitutional, but it hasn't been declared such, so the law remains legal to enforce.

Thus, if the SCOTUS has not heard a case and ruled that state gun registries are unconstitutional, then such registries remain legal for those states to have and enforce.  If a circuit appeals court has heard & decided a case stating that they are unconstitutional, then such registries only become illegal in the states within that circuit, and remain legal in states outside of it.

So if you want to convince me that state/local gun registries are unconstitutional and therefore illegal and therefore the government breaking its own laws, you're going to have to show me a SCOTUS case where they determined them to be unconstitutional.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.76

The problem is, if that were the case, then those prosecuted under the law would continue serving their original sentences after the ruling because the law wouldn't have been considered unconstitutional for practical purposes until the court ruled on it. Instead, a law exists with an inherent property of whether or not it's constitutional. The courts only determine whether that inherent property is true or false, but it doesn't give it that property. If the court gave it that property, it would only be practicable from that point on, but all prior actions taken would be considered constitutional.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.926

So, when a law is declared unconstitutional, it usually doesn't automatically reverse any convictions under the law (""non-retroactive"" is the default for these decisions, though the court can decide to make them retroactive during its ruling).  But you can appeal to have your conviction overturned, and if you wouldn't have been convicted under the new, revised law, then your conviction will be overturned.  Obviously, that's because the thing you did never should have been illegal in the first place because the law should never have existed.

So, in a way you are correct that laws have an inherent property of constitutionality that a court determines the nature of.  But at the same time, that property isn't objective because the courts must interpret the constitution and different people interpret it differently, so something that's constitutional now may be ruled unconstitutional 30 years later when a case is revisited.  And it could theoretically be revisited another 30 years later by a new court and be declared constitutional again.  So it's a sort of schroedinger's constitutionality, where it is both constitutional and unconstitutional until it is observed, and treated as constitutional by default until declared otherwise.

So in other words, whether or not YOU feel something is unconstitutional, it's not actually illegal until the COURT says it is.  Because THEIR interpretation of the constitution is the one that determines the law, not yours.  Do you see what I'm saying?",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.738

I would absolutely love to see what the founding fathers would think of what's going on right now.  I especially wonder what they'd say about the entire second amendment argument vs our numbers of gun deaths.

I mean, the best small-arms technology they had back then was the flintlock mechanism, which couldn't fire reliably or at all in damp weather and required manual reloading where you had to put powder in the flash pan and stuff the shot down the barrel with a ramrod, and 4 rounds per minute was considered fast - sometimes too fast, since the guns would misfire if any burning powder was left in the barrel when you put the new powder in.  The next big advancement in firearms tech was the percussion cap around the 1820s, but it still required manual reloading, it just turned the flash pan powder into a self-contained cartridge.  So even then, best tech was still 4 rounds per minute, it was just a more consistent and reliable, all-weather 4 rounds per minute.  And then revolvers, the next big improvement which took the human reloading time out of the equation and allowed several shots fired in a row, those weren't widely available until the late 1830s when Samuel Colt patented a reliable cylinder mechanism and started mass-producing them.

So when they wrote that the government shall not infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms, the most advanced small arms they could imagine was one that improved on the flintlock - a 4 RPM rifle or musket that could fire in the rain and maybe wouldn't misfire if you reloaded it too fast.  And the last founding father died the same year Colt patented his revolvers, so they were all dead before anyone could ever expect that the average American would be able to fire more than 1 shot without taking at least 10 to 15 seconds to reload the next one.  Double-action, spring-loaded magazines, semi-auto, burst fire, full-auto - they couldn't even have predicted any of that, or the problems we'd have 200+ years later because one single sentence out of a 5,000 word document wasn't written clearly enough and didn't explain how ""well-regulated"" and ""shall not infringe"" were supposed to reconcile with each other.

It makes me wonder if they would've written that differently, had they known that someday Tommy guns and AKs and AR15s would exist, and that evil people would use them to terrorize, harm, and kill thousands of innocent people per year.  Would they feel they should have clarified their intent more?  That they should have defined what ""well-regulated"" meant, or clarified the expectation of keeping a militia, or specified what kinds of arms people had the right to keep and bear, or where they could be kept, or specified that they shall not be infringed ""without due process of the law,"" or...? Or would they, like we have, accept that those lives are simply the cost of preserving a free republic, and change nothing?

I'm sure we both have our own opinions on that, and they're probably very different, but neither one is any more or less valid than the other because we just can't know without being able to ask them.  So.  I think about that a lot.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.734

Uhh huhh and how you suppose you go about a ban logistically speaking when the majority of the 270m - 310m firearms are of the type you would like to see prohibited?  Canada dissolved their long gun registry because it threatened to bankrupt the nation.  Imagine what it would do the U.S..

Hi cap magazines?  Ya a think tank estimates roughly 4 times the number of estimated firearms in the country for those.  I'd think the rate of compliance on a turn in would be dismal and so you would be left with an ongoing confiscation.

Just to have some context the Aussies port arthur regulations had about a 1/3 rate of compliance as 1/3 of the registered firearms in Australia were turned in willingly and upon arrest of a criminal and seized.  And that was the Aussies which we hear wanted these gun controls yet only 1/3 of the prohibited firearms were and are dealt with?  The rest remain a decade after the ban?

AP rounds:
1) Used against anyone wearing armor (tyrannical government agents, armored mass shooters etc)
2) They are not used crimes frequently a gang shootings/mass shootings involve soft targets.
3) Fun.

Silencers:

First silencers aren't really used in crimes, they don't make guns completely quiet, they only muffle the sound. And they don't actually make a gun more lethal. they actually make guns less lethal, the projectile loses power and is less accurate with a suppressor. And why I need one is if by chance someone invades my home and deadly force this necessary. The silencer helps reduce the concussive effect a gun shot has when indoors.
Now for AP rounds, you mentioned the lives of police being in danger, but you are making the assumption that only police have body armor.

That's where the big uproar came from. It wasn't so much the mentality ill part, but the social security part that pissed the gun community off.

When a right wing hears government regulation, I feel they see lines of gun drops and bar codes and serial numbers and lists and government tags on their weapons and secret agendas and having their tools they need to survive taken away.
When a left wing hears government regulation, they think: more funding into education about safety for guns and fund massive studies to figure out every statistic from every angle about guns and enact gun safety laws we know work now about gun checks and regulate gun shows and more vetting for those that statistically have violent tendencies, and make it a national thing to look at how other countries have solved gun issues.

And either way the answer is: yes.   If you take out guns and apply anything like the kkk, civil rights, britain, or really anything... yes, there is always opposition and you beat it by not backing down.
that american psychology study said 3-5% of mass shootings are down by the mentally ill for various reasons.  so that would only fix 5% of it.  it's the guns. it's the easy accessibly mass amount of guns.

to make the same comparison mabye regulate it similar to where we pay for the class and if we fail to  update registration then we aren't allowed to use the firearm similar to a car with expired tags.

Personally I think we should have classes like you described for drivers because some people shouldn't be driving on the road after 15 to 20 years but that's a new can of worms to tackle.

Fact: There are 320 million people in America but only 628,000 police officers. (But we all know the Left hates police)

Fact: A recent National Association of Chiefs of Police survey found that 86.4 percent of 20,000 police chiefs and sheriffs support concealed carry and are overwhelmingly against further gun control. 

Fact: According to the Centers for Disease Control, which found that gun ownership increased by 56 percent, and yet gun violence declined by almost 50 percent 

Fact: A Nov. 26, 2013 study found that, between 1980 and 2009, ""assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level"" and ""states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.

Fact: Senator Dianne Feinstein, a gun control advocate, carried a concealed gun when her life was threatened and her home attacked by the New World Liberation Front in the 1970s. 

Fact: According to the CDC's ""Leading Causes of Death Reports,"" between 1999 and 2013, Americans were 21.5 times more likely to die of heart disease (9,691,733 deaths); 18.7 times more likely to die of malignant tumors (8,458,868 deaths); and 2.4 times more likely to die of diabetes or 2.3 times more likely to die of Alzheimer's (1,080,298 and 1,053,207 respectively) than to die from a firearm (whether by accident, homicide, or suicide). [4] The flu and related pneumonia (875,143 deaths); traffic accidents (594,280 deaths); and poisoning whether via accident, homicide, or suicide (475,907 deaths) all killed more people between 1999 and 2013 than firearms. 

Fact: Japan has a low gun ownership rate at 0.6 guns per 100 people and a high suicide rate of 18.41 suicides per 100,000 people in 1997 (ranking it 11 out of 71 countries). South Korea has a low gun ownership rate (1.1 guns per 100 people) but has a high rate of suicide and the highest rate of gun suicides (12.63 per 100,000 people in 1997). By contrast the United States has the 26th highest suicide rate (12.3 suicides per 100,000 people in 2011) and the highest gun ownership rate (88.8 guns per 100 people).

Fact:Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet, in 2012, Mexico had 11,309 gun murders (9.97 gun homicides per 100,000 people) compared to the United States that had 9,146 gun homicides (2.97 per 100,000 people).

Fact: Gun massacres are not the only or even the most lethal form of gun violence.

Fact: A ban on military-style weapons of the kind used in the two most recent high-profile gun massacres and in so many others before—wouldn’t have an effect on gun violence in America, which tends to be concentrated on handguns.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.588

I am going to quote the Heller vs. D.C. decision directly because I think you will understand. The following is the published majority opinion of the Supreme Court in Heller vs. D.C.

""Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.

What's to stop some anti-gun psych from edging as many people out as he can? Even considering all of that, this is a significant block to exercise a natural right. Also, if ""people with violent tendencies or mental illness are a grave threat to society at large"", why aren't you arguing that they should just be locked away?

Are you unfamiliar with US v. Miller? ""In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.""

Yeah, Ira Isaacs was arrested under Bush legislation. Need I bring up the highly unconstitutional Patriot Act? Bush's ""smut task force"" was deemed unconstitutional before it was ever formed by US v. Flint.

""Private Establishment: I can deny all free speech rights of anyone inside a private dwelling provided I follow all other laws.""

Of course. You can tell me that I can't carry a gun on your premises. That's well within your right. However, what natural rights I exercise in my home or in public areas is not within your power to stop.

to decide who gets to have guns and who does not. If a cop arrests someone, they don't need a valid reason, cops make 
up and falsify charges all the time. And, if you happen to get arrested for anything, guess what, even if you beat the 
charge/s, have no conviction, you still will have a criminal history that comes up on background checks. 

Look, it won't say on your background check that you was never convicted, that you were proven NOT guilty. 
Just being arrested, and a cop can do this to anyone, don't need a valid reason. All it will say is two words, 
""criminal history"" and that's all. People will assume the worst. This for sure will prevent you from buying a gun
but it has more serious implications. Like keep you from finding work, getting into housing or an apartment. 

Cops are the last people in the world who should decide who should and shouldn't be armed. They will allow
guns for themselves and their friends and exclude them from anyone they take issue with not because they
might be a threat, but because they are being petty and seeking revenge. Cops murder 30 or more people a day. 
Kelly Thomas, John Crawford, Tamir Rice, John T Williams, Louis Rodriguz, Dillon Taylor, Jason Harrison, 
Sam Debose,,, these cops are real terrorists in the US. 

TYT would take guns away from peaceful non violent people and give them to these cops who have 
proven they are violent, that they will murder on a whim and get away with it. Are we to believe that 
cops perceive a threat from music headphones, or a wood carving, a screw driver, a toy sold at Walmart
out of it's box on their shelf? 

I can't read a book in my car at night without these police accusing me of breaking into cars. I can't
purchase lemonade at a grocery store with public access without being arrested. I can't even go to my
bank to get statements going back 6 months to qualify for an apartment without a ronald richie

You prove it time and time again by dodging what you yourself are comfortable regulating. And your fatuous claim that arms means firearms also doesn't hold up. Because we both probably agree that munitions using gunpowder can be large enough to warrant restrictions.

That is why I ask what your interpretation of what ""bear"" means in the Constitution. Is it a hundred pound gun? A 5 pound gun? What do you think? Or do you think ""bear"" simply means possess?

We can disagree, but please have a coherent narrative. So far I have yet to hear one from you or any other gun advocates. You and they both pretend their opinions are laid out in the Constitution. They are not.

And so, instead of passing legislation that put a stop to that,  instead everyone else is going to be inconvenienced."" ~ Ana Kasparian. That same argument is what gun proponents often use against supporters of gun control following mass shootings; namely that the ideas being bandied about won't actually fix/prevent the issue they seek to. For instance when Kimmel was targeting the ""gun show loophole"" following the Vegas shooting even though the killer has a clean criminal record and it wouldn't have changed anything. Or when there are calls to ban rifles when the vast majority of gun crimes and murders are with handguns.

There is also the way the media covers guns - With the Texas church shooting, the media would often describe the killer's gun as an ""assault weapon"" and at the same time describe the gun of the person who stopped him as a ""hunting rifle"" even though both of them used the same exact type of gun; namely an AR-15. As such, it's this slight of hand by the media that gun proponents also complain about; saying that it makes it difficult to have an honest conversation about the subject.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.824

@Ali Jordan That's where you are wrong. The government right now could turn the whole country to glowing green glass by destroying everything with atomic weapons. That destroys their tax farm though. The country is useless to them unless they take it in one piece or close to. A predator drone can not enforce a curfew. A stealth bomber can not raid a home and take it's guns. A battleship can not break up a riot. A submarine can not burn the books. Boots are needed on the ground to enforce a police state. When the citizens have guns the police are less powerful.

Drugs are now illegal in the US but we still face an epidemic. 
Yet in countries like Portugal and Amsterdam where drugs 
have been decriminalized there has been large reductions in 
crime and addiction.
This shows that prohibition does not work and that if there is a 
demand, regardless of laws it will create a criminal market for it. 
If you look at statistics we see a large spike in gun violence 
preceding such gun bans.
I am not an advocate for guns and I don't even own any, 
But I do research and the way to go is harsher sentencing for 
any acts where guns are used in perpetrating a crime. 
As for mass gun violence, this is only a small portion of gun 
deaths and is tied to mental health issues. 
The LV Shooter also had explosives that he could have used. 
He could have as easily used a bomb to kill even more 
people then he had. 
Anyway all this is moot as the constitution protects gun
advocates with the right to choose. 
The solutions for all issues are not always bans.

UgyiDKIW4BrNEz6ROo94AaABAg,Raven JBA,1 month ago,1510992670570,"‪Capitalism=private parties own businesses, not the state.‬

‪Free Market= consumers dictate supply and demand, deciding with their currency/energy which businesses thrive/fail ‬

‪Communism= the government knows best, obey the central state, your benevolent representatives have no self interest and work for you. ‬

True moral communism only exists in a tribal hunting/gathering state. Consensual agreement for survival. But we are self-sufficient individuals, not a tribal commune. And we do NOT consent to central control. So that consent must be manufactured through ignorance and fear. Hegelian dialectic; torture the subject so that they cry out for a solution, then provide centralization and consensual enslavement as their only escape from pain. One step in the ritual to cast the spell of enthrallment. 

If you want help you cannot receive it at the end of a blade/gun. The modern communist is simply the willing sheep of the monarchs; you are the propagator of the propaganda carefully fed to you by the word smiths, the masons, the devils, the deal makers, the chess players, the confidence-men, black magicians, suicidal nihilists, eugenicists, Nazi's,  the cult of science, chaining Mother Nature to the wall, torturing the secrets from her flesh. A means to an end of domination and conquest. Survival of the fittest. 

Do not prostitute your will to the players who see you only as a moveable piece. Do not allow emotionally comforting idealism and artificially manufactured evils to blind you to the slow encroachment of centralization and the subtle attacks which pave its way. The proletariat has always been the tool of the bourgeoisie, they rise up not against the rulers, but against the competitors. The proletariat is just a piece used to put the enemy king in check. The Empire has already been built; 15 more years till its completion. Now it must fall. It WILL fall; the waking dead will dismantle it and take their place as the true kings.

In Canada, we (conservatives) like our universal healthcare (not going bankrupt is nice) however wait times have forced many Canadian families to seek medical help in the states as no system is ever perfect.
We also enjoy not having to work 2 full time jobs just to stay in university. Outside of undergrad (grad and med school) everything is covered.
Surprisingly Alberta which is considered the Texas of Canada is #4 out of 13 in highest minimum wage which likely is due to low population.
However we (conservatives) don't like our speech laws being restricted to the point where criticizing a religion can land you in jail for hate crime.
Our guns laws suck (from a pro gun perspective) as you can own a type 81 semi auto with a basic gun license and no registration while an AK47 is flat out banned and AR's require a special license that makes go through another gun safety class and have the gun registered.

There are bombs that can eliminate entire countries from existence.  There are diseases that can destroy modern civilization.  There is no difference in severity relative to size between them.  Neither is there a measurable difference between the killing potential of a human being with legal, or illegal access to specialized firearms.

If someone wants to kill a lot of people, they can do so.  With or without guns and gunmods.

And if you had a real education, you would realize that the cost of regulating Gunmods, in a world with consumer level 3D printers, is wildly prohibitive.  Rendering any logical attempt at gun control regulation down to Security Theater on the cost to benefit ratio of the TSA.

It would cost Tax Payer money to create the illusion of effective Gun Control regulation, and the instant someone with illegal arms or gunmods commits a mass shooting, the entire regulatory structure will break down, and people will lose their jobs for nothing.  It is a lose/lose/lose with no possibility of ever saving a single human life.  The only effect will be great cost and severe loss.

This is why comprehensive and internationally competitive education must become a human right.  So lumps of human shit cannot pretend to have an opinion just as valuable as proven facts.

Here's exactly how thing will play out with a transfer of liability over time.  

In the beginning, people will complain about it and the fact that they have to fill it out unless they want to be charged as an accessory in some fashion should the gun be used in a crime.

Over time, the number of guns being sold without the transfer of liability will drop.  As the number of guns without a proper paper trail diminishes due to being used in crimes and seized by the authorities or kept by collectors, the cost of those guns will increase.

As the cost of those guns increases, the number of them being used for crimes will decrease.  People who claim to be law abiding citizens but not want the government to ""know what guns they have"" will add to the scarcity of guns on the black market.

Eventually, a bare minimum circulation state will be reached in which only guns smuggled into the country or stolen from legitimate gun owners (who will hopefully report the theft, least they be charged) will be available to criminals and gun runners.

As the number of illegal guns and gun crimes diminishes, more and more people will support and adhere to the transfer of liability laws in order to protect their rights to own a gun legally.

In the end, gun violence will drop, illegal gun sales and trafficking will drop, and those law abiding gun owners can have a legitimate defense for legal gun ownership not being a constant cause for controversy.

Yes there will still be mass shootings and crazies, but the over all number of incidents and severity of most incidents will drop.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.611
