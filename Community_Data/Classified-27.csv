Drug pushers who fight against police forces who will simply arrest, not senselessly kill them just because of the drugs as much of the media wants you to believe, and I believe that the vigilantes should be controlled, because I think they've killed much more than the police has.
Also, there are supporters of Duterte who don't support so much killings, however he is indeed making the most change out of the deep-seated corruption in the Philippine government present throughout history, from the money to abuse of power and so on. I mean, even in the election a few of the candidates he ran against was paying others to vote for him and one got in because she had a rich and famous father.
Filipinos do not love dictators or mass killings- they want change, and believe that Duterte is the most suitable candidate to make that change. The same reason that Trump was elected, I believe.

Lots of sicario type people are becoming gunned down ( Just like in Colombia during the time of Pablo Escobar). So yup TYT are pretty clueless about what's going on in the Philippines in this instance. Duterte enjoys his popularity because most filipinos see a decrease in overall crime. Lost an extended family member to crime there but it's a country where you can't bring a criminal to justice for fear of reprisals. Most filipinos are fed up with crime in their country. There are opportunities for addicts to change their life around and a lot of drug dealers are killed by drug lords so TYT isn't telling the whole story.

And I find it odd you didn't suggest this solution for America as well; which has a horrible drug problem, one of the worst in the world.  America is the world's leading consumer of cocaine, one of the leading world consumers of crystal meth, and has one of the world's highest death rates for drug abuse.  Why have you only suggested this for countries south of America?  

Though you really should know that's like healing a wounded arm by chopping it off.  You now have a bigger wound and you can still get wounds on other parts of your body; so the problem of wounds, what causes them, and how to heal them still exist.  You just have one less arm to worry about getting wounded, at a high price to pay.

The wealthy drug lords will still be around, as these are often people with positions of great influence, and enough protection that no vigilantes or police dare walk up and shoot them; and history has shown that an all-out armed attack by the authorities almost always fails to kill them and leads to many, many innocent casualties as well as the death of many members of law enforcement and the government in the process, or as victims of retribution assassinations afterwards.  Mexico tried a forceful war on drugs and it backfired horribly on them.

And the problems causing drug use still exist.  People who are poor and destitute will still be desperate enough to want to find some way to forget their misery.  Mentally ill and the sick and injured that can't get treatment will still try to find ways to self-medicate.  Those with rough times in their lives will still try to find ways to forget their woes.

Try to check other angle,   coz there are some people's point of view including me,  that  those high rank people who are involved into Drug syndicate , meaning , operator of drugs business  or protectors (rich people and government officials )  are most probably responsible on these ""Killings""  of whoever they thought  that can caused of the revelation of their involvements.

The figures mumbled by that moron ugly guy (X) and witch-looking idiot lady (Y) here in TYT are a big FAKE NEWS. Never ever believe them. In less than a minute, the 10K figure given by Y became 100K as pronounced by X. What an insult to peace-loving and law-abiding Filipinos! The real picture is: there's no 100K deaths in the Philippines due to war on drugs. There were over 1M surrenderers, alive, during Duterte's 1st year in service, who are now in rehab centers. Most of them are users if not small-time peddlers. Meanwhile, Police actions resulted to a little over 3K deaths of hard-core illegal drug personalities as they fought back to authorities. Unless the Philippines legalizes currently classified illegal drugs,  people involved in this trade are criminals. Remember. They are CRIMINALS who terrorize weak and innocent ones. Fortunately or unfortunately, these people are armed and dangerous. Anyway, the rest of the 9K deaths is due to in-fighting among gangs and cartels. There are DUIs (death-under-investigations) which have already been solved and some are still on going. Isn't that due process? Isn't that rule of law?

In the recent past, illegal drugs in the Philippines had caused tens of thousands of deaths, namely, rapes and murders of toddlers, grandmas, mothers; killings of relatives and friends, hold-ups, bank robberies, hostage takings, name it and you'll have it. A few were reported and some unreported due to threats. This is the truthful, as in, honest picture before Duterte came in as president. News black-out? Yes, mainstream media didn't feature them so well in the past as they feature them now.

All these are residues of the incompetent and corrupt immediate past administration of Noynoy Aquino. Duterte is just doing campaign his promises to us Filipinos and not to idiot paid media; firstly to eradicate illegal drugs from the streets among Filipino communities and secondly, to minimize if not eliminate corruption in government left by the past administration.

FYI, these noisy Filipino opposition and paid local mainstream media are only making the best of the legal terminologies just to beautify the fortification of their sins while they were in power from 2010-2016. Filipinos via Duterte are now getting back to them. Some of them are now starting to go to jail.

TYT and the rest of the mainstream media, Why can you afford to lie to your audience. Observe as in practice investigative journalism else you look like paid by either drug lords if not by Trump's foes. You sound like FAKE NEWS promoter.

Looking at those facts alone should tell you that the president never made such an official order (to kill them on sight), only phrases in his speeches that were taken out of context. 

Furthermore, his (Duterte) government has also constructed a number of drug rehab facilities -- even military camps were used temporarily to help addicts get back on their feet. So, yeah, Duterte IS leaning towards helping people reform. But I guess you don't know about that because it wasn't widely covered by the media, right? 

You don't have to be a genius to realize that, the Philippines is deeply corrupted. High-ranking officials are basically stakeholders to these drug dealers, and they also have stakes in the news outlets (the previous president is literally the brother of a figurehead in ABS-CBN -- the mainstream media here).

Unless you have access to reliable information, including your firsthand observation, you shouldn't make statements that can escalate issues needlessly. That's why I also hate other Filipinos who rallies and causes a nuisance of themselves just because Trump is visiting. Like, wtf did they he even do to them, right?

For the sake of those who are unaware, over 700,000 drug suspects (including users and pushers) were apprehended safely,  while only 3,000-ish were killed in legitimate police operations (mainstream sources cite 12,000 deaths, but that number included murders by unidentified gunmen). 

Looking at those facts alone should tell you that the president never made such an official order (to kill them on sight), only phrases in his speeches that were taken out of context. 

Furthermore, his (Duterte) government has also constructed a number of drug rehab facilities -- even military camps were used temporarily to help addicts get back on their feet. So, yeah, Duterte IS leaning towards helping people reform. 

You don't have to be a genius to realize that, the Philippines is deeply corrupted.

Looking at those facts alone should tell you that the president never made such an official order (to kill them on sight), only phrases in his speeches that were taken out of context. 

Furthermore, his (Duterte) government has also constructed a number of drug rehab facilities -- even military camps were used temporarily to help addicts get back on their feet. So, yeah, Duterte IS leaning towards helping people reform. But I guess you don't know about that because it wasn't widely covered by the media, right? 

You don't have to be a genius to realize that, the Philippines is deeply corrupted. High-ranking officials are basically stakeholders to these drug dealers, and they also have stakes in the news outlets (the previous president is literally the brother of a figurehead in ABS-CBN -- the mainstream media here).

Yes, and looked how messed up the Philippines are. Centuries of Spanish neglect and religion and 50 years of Hollywood and corruption, poor fuckers.

You know that corruption and globalism are very different things, right? They are also not equally bad.

""Russia is one of the most powerful countries in the world and the Eurasia region and absolutely necessary to peacefully resolve the North Korea situation, is fighting ISIS and Putin is also against globalism.""
Only because they have nukes, economically they are tiny. They are not at all necessary to NK, why on earth do you think that? Only China and NK are essential in that situation.

You are saying:
1 Agree
2 Agree but disagree on semantics because Corruption and Golabalism overlap but are not one and the same.
3 Agree & Disagree, Putin is against globalization AND is Necessary to resolve NK. The Nations We need to successfully and peacefully Resolve NK: South Korea, Russia, China(These three border NK and have the NEARBY INFRASTRUCTURE to help), Japan, Vietnam, Philippines, Taiwan(These are the largest players and targets in NK conflict).
If we are to eliminate NK and save their people with minmal bloodshed USA needs SK,Russia,China, Japan, Taiwan Vietnam, Philippines,Australia, New Zealand to all help.
The best solution is to Blitzkrieg the Kim Government, oust them from power at the same time as disabling their ordinance.
And then occupy and rebuild NK Marshal plan style like we did Japan and Germany after WWII.

2 Russia is a power player in the region, and until recently a major reason we haven't handled the Kim regime previously, it shares a border and shares in the risk of a nuclear holocaust and to act like them being on our side is useless is completely retarded.

3 Yes, that is the best solution, believe it or not. 
NK has the ability to kill Millions of S.Koreans right now and they threaten to do so all the time unless they receive payment.
They literally have so many munitions pointed at SK that at 1 order from Kim Millions if not 10s of Millions of lives are currently within range of NK artillery/munitions et al. 
Every president before Trump, capitulated and gave them payment and NK has continued to move towards proliferation.
We have a few ways this can end:
A: We capitulate until NK is a Nuclear power and attacks the US/SK/Japan etc.
B: We capitulate until NK has a revolution from within(not likely)
C: We get a coalition of US,Russia,SK,Japan,China, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, Australia & New Zealand... we eliminate simultaneously:  1 Kim & Regime 2 Munitions pointed at SK 3 All lines of communication AND then proceed to rebuild NK post WWII style.

So if republicans actually cut taxes while cutting spending simultaneously, it would necessarily slow economic growth. That's why it doesn't work at a state level, such as Kansas. Federally, it has only ""worked"" when spending also increased and provided a Keynesian stimulus, such as during Reagan with military spending. Still, there was more economic growth in the 1970s than in the 1980s.

But drug addicts are not the ones being hunted down, they are encouraged to go to newly built rehab centers. The ones that they are looking for are the drug Lords, WHO ARE MOSTLY VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE and some are even in the government. They would do whatever it takes to stay in power. Some are killing their own drug dealers. Duterte is a threat to the most corrupt governors and drug Lords in our country.
