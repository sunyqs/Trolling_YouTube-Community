Drug pushers who fight against police forces who will simply arrest, not senselessly kill them just because of the drugs as much of the media wants you to believe, and I believe that the vigilantes should be controlled, because I think they've killed much more than the police has.
Also, there are supporters of Duterte who don't support so much killings, however he is indeed making the most change out of the deep-seated corruption in the Philippine government present throughout history, from the money to abuse of power and so on. I mean, even in the election a few of the candidates he ran against was paying others to vote for him and one got in because she had a rich and famous father.
Filipinos do not love dictators or mass killings- they want change, and believe that Duterte is the most suitable candidate to make that change. The same reason that Trump was elected, I believe.

Lost an extended family member to crime there but it's a country where you can't bring a criminal to justice for fear of reprisals. Most filipinos are fed up with crime in their country. There are opportunities for addicts to change their life around and a lot of drug dealers are killed by drug lords so TYT isn't telling the whole story. Expected more of them but instead they are just parroting their privileged world view without actually going to the Philippines to see the real conditions and real situation there.,2,true,1,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.881

And I find it odd you didn't suggest this solution for America as well; which has a horrible drug problem, one of the worst in the world.  America is the world's leading consumer of cocaine, one of the leading world consumers of crystal meth, and has one of the world's highest death rates for drug abuse.  Why have you only suggested this for countries south of America?  

Though you really should know that's like healing a wounded arm by chopping it off.  You now have a bigger wound and you can still get wounds on other parts of your body; so the problem of wounds, what causes them, and how to heal them still exist.  You just have one less arm to worry about getting wounded, at a high price to pay.

The wealthy drug lords will still be around, as these are often people with positions of great influence, and enough protection that no vigilantes or police dare walk up and shoot them; and history has shown that an all-out armed attack by the authorities almost always fails to kill them and leads to many, many innocent casualties as well as the death of many members of law enforcement and the government in the process, or as victims of retribution assassinations afterwards.  Mexico tried a forceful war on drugs and it backfired horribly on them.

And the problems causing drug use still exist.  People who are poor and destitute will still be desperate enough to want to find some way to forget their misery.  Mentally ill and the sick and injured that can't get treatment will still try to find ways to self-medicate.  Those with rough times in their lives will still try to find ways to forget their woes.

How sure are you that  those  people who had been killed were only Drug Addicts?? ,  
How  sure  we are that the said  killings were ordered by Duterte  or  if He was really involved??
I am not Duterte''s supporter,  and  I also   didn't vote him  as President,  but in fairness to our President , on the record, there are a lot of things or I should say those kind of things or problems of our country  that we have for over  decades  now that Only Duterte made a lot of changes and difference, started to do solutions.

My point here is, please do not Judge , do not accused and do not  blame  the President  for every  crime happened in our country.
Try to check other angle,   coz there are some people's point of view including me,  that  those high rank people who are involved into Drug syndicate , meaning , operator of drugs business  or protectors (rich people and government officials )  are most probably responsible on these ""Killings""  of whoever they thought  that can caused of the revelation of their involvements.

Well,  anyone of us doesn't know the real stories behind  of each crime happened in our country,  so  no one can ever tell that there is a Judicial Killing here and this is by our President.

The figures mumbled by that moron ugly guy (X) and witch-looking idiot lady (Y) here in TYT are a big FAKE NEWS. Never ever believe them. In less than a minute, the 10K figure given by Y became 100K as pronounced by X. What an insult to peace-loving and law-abiding Filipinos! The real picture is: there's no 100K deaths in the Philippines due to war on drugs. There were over 1M surrenderers, alive, during Duterte's 1st year in service, who are now in rehab centers. Most of them are users if not small-time peddlers. Meanwhile, Police actions resulted to a little over 3K deaths of hard-core illegal drug personalities as they fought back to authorities. Unless the Philippines legalizes currently classified illegal drugs,  people involved in this trade are criminals. Remember. They are CRIMINALS who terrorize weak and innocent ones. Fortunately or unfortunately, these people are armed and dangerous. Anyway, the rest of the 9K deaths is due to in-fighting among gangs and cartels. There are DUIs (death-under-investigations) which have already been solved and some are still on going. Isn't that due process? Isn't that rule of law?

In the recent past, illegal drugs in the Philippines had caused tens of thousands of deaths, namely, rapes and murders of toddlers, grandmas, mothers; killings of relatives and friends, hold-ups, bank robberies, hostage takings, name it and you'll have it. A few were reported and some unreported due to threats. This is the truthful, as in, honest picture before Duterte came in as president. News black-out? Yes, mainstream media didn't feature them so well in the past as they feature them now.

All these are residues of the incompetent and corrupt immediate past administration of Noynoy Aquino. Duterte is just doing campaign his promises to us Filipinos and not to idiot paid media; firstly to eradicate illegal drugs from the streets among Filipino communities and secondly, to minimize if not eliminate corruption in government left by the past administration.

FYI, these noisy Filipino opposition and paid local mainstream media are only making the best of the legal terminologies just to beautify the fortification of their sins while they were in power from 2010-2016. Filipinos via Duterte are now getting back to them. Some of them are now starting to go to jail.

TYT and the rest of the mainstream media, Why can you afford to lie to your audience. Observe as in practice investigative journalism else you look like paid by either drug lords if not by Trump's foes. You sound like FAKE NEWS promoter.

I wonder how many innocent people have been murdered in these ""Extra Judicial Killings?"" In Duterte's zealous drive to make the Philippines ""civilized"" he has achieved the opposite.

Some can have them killed (Duterte, Putin), some just can't, even if they really wanted to (Trump). So they try to damage their credibility by constantly calling them ""fake news"".

Having one Kim Jong Un is already bad enough, we should not be tolerating or buddying up with someone like Duterte. And yeah, Trump shouldn't ""be mean"" like he's some goddamn 5 year old at recess, he should be firm and assertive like an adult.

Discipline is restoring in the Philippines, I'm not saying that my people is too disrespectful in many things but some simple things and major issues are now being fixed. We all do want due process on anything. Not gonna lie, our government has alot of laws passed for the public but are they all being implemented and recognized by the public? IF Duterte was never the president of the country, whose gonna fix the long term issues we have in our country, like the drug addiction is spreading like an epidemic on our society? A lot of things changed like the traffic enforcers are now engaged to penalize jeepney drivers loading/unloading on wrong areas, minors are now more engaged on staying out of the streets before the curfew starts, drastic change on less crimes in general like we've never seen before, alot of drug users surrendered last time to admit and swear their oath to change for the future (it doesn't assure that they will actually change but it's a small step for a big change for their future), more strict on implementing vending on the streets, (because alot of mobile vendors before are making some public areas look really messy).

Unless you have access to reliable information, including your firsthand observation, you shouldn't make statements that can escalate issues needlessly. That's why I also hate other Filipinos who rallies and causes a nuisance of themselves just because Trump is visiting. Like, wtf did they he even do to them, right?

For the sake of those who are unaware, over 700,000 drug suspects (including users and pushers) were apprehended safely,  while only 3,000-ish were killed in legitimate police operations (mainstream sources cite 12,000 deaths, but that number included murders by unidentified gunmen). 

Looking at those facts alone should tell you that the president never made such an official order (to kill them on sight), only phrases in his speeches that were taken out of context. 

Furthermore, his (Duterte) government has also constructed a number of drug rehab facilities -- even military camps were used temporarily to help addicts get back on their feet. So, yeah, Duterte IS leaning towards helping people reform. 

You don't have to be a genius to realize that, the Philippines is deeply corrupted.

Only because they have nukes, economically they are tiny. They are not at all necessary to NK, why on earth do you think that? Only China and NK are essential in that situation. Everyone is fighting ISIS, so what? And Putin is against globalism? Hardly a ringing endorsement from the worlds largest corruption machine, is it?

2 Russia is a power player in the region, and until recently a major reason we haven't handled the Kim regime previously, it shares a border and shares in the risk of a nuclear holocaust and to act like them being on our side is useless is completely retarded.

3 Yes, that is the best solution, believe it or not. 
NK has the ability to kill Millions of S.Koreans right now and they threaten to do so all the time unless they receive payment.
They literally have so many munitions pointed at SK that at 1 order from Kim Millions if not 10s of Millions of lives are currently within range of NK artillery/munitions et al. 
Every president before Trump, capitulated and gave them payment and NK has continued to move towards proliferation.
We have a few ways this can end:
A: We capitulate until NK is a Nuclear power and attacks the US/SK/Japan etc.
B: We capitulate until NK has a revolution from within(not likely)
C: We get a coalition of US,Russia,SK,Japan,China, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, Australia & New Zealand... we eliminate simultaneously:  1 Kim & Regime 2 Munitions pointed at SK 3 All lines of communication AND then proceed to rebuild NK post WWII style.
