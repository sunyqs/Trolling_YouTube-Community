My theory is that part of that confidence also occurs because we have stereotyped well-dressed people as successful. Granted, these stereotypes were established in the early to mid 1900's when the only successful women were so successful BECAUSE they married successful men, and the men usually had their clothes bought or tailored for them because that's what they liked.

No one has the right to abuse or harass a person, but attractiveness gains more attention. If someone does a doubletake at your ass in some tight jeans it's a trade off. Maybe don't wear tight jeans if you don't want that attention. However if someone slaps your ass now they have crossed the line. That is not your fault no matter what you're wearing.

Men are mainly attracted to women who are beautiful, why do you think women dress up nice? To make themselves more beautiful visually to attract more men so they have more men to choose from( well also to make women jealous but that's another discussion).  And women want an attractive man , and a man that can support them and their future kids( meaning financially), so men will to an extent do what they can to look better(but it's harder overall for men to do this then women because of how the genders are built) ,  so the only thing left for them to do attract a lot of women in order to have a larger pool to choose a mate from is to look like they can support a woman (again mainly financially) is to look like they can or do things that make I seem they can support a women better then the next guy.

Men dress up, get groomed, work out, become financially successful and make things because it will attract a suitable mate. Women get attractive and doll up because they want to find a suitable mate that will protect her, and make her happy. Which is why studies have been done where women chose attractiveness in a guy depending on the type of car that he's driving even though its the same man (I'm not kidding search this up). He's not wrong, and you guys are not really trying to hear him out. You just want to shout sexist, or label him an asshole when all he's trying to do is speak truth. If men did not have women to impress they wouldn't do the shit they do. If women didn't have men they probably would see no need to doll up. Hes giving women a cheat code at how to play the system of men and get ahead, and you guys are still mad?! About what? Like what exactly has got u pissed? Yes women get raped, yes women make less than men, yes we live in a patriarchal society, but Gene Simmons is not giving you the answer to all those problems.

If a woman wanted to she could easily find someone to have sex with in 30min or less. but a man may have to search far and wide to find a woman that is fine with his overweight ass whose only attractive feature is his car (self reflection). to prove this point I point to dating sites. if you know anything about dating sites, you'll know that all it is is 5000 guys trying to chat it up with 50 women. obviously it's not because there are less women, it's because there are way less women who are as desperate as guys. and that is due both to women wanting sex less frequently on average than men, and because when they do want it it is much easier for them to obtain. you are getting angry at him for making what you think is a sexist point, but he's just stating the truth (for the most part). he's not saying that this is the way it should be he's saying this is the way it is. and you can't say it's not because you complain (rightfully) about it regularly. and you could argue that he claimed it's human nature which means we can't change it, and so he wants to keep it just the way it is. however, we are humans so technically anything we do is human nature, and if it's a societal problem then it's a human nature problem, but human nature can be changed. it changes all the time.",4,FALSE,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.711

To say a man who is below-average in looks, lacks charisma, and doesn't groom well - can get ahead just as easily as an attractive male is also denial of reality. It's annoying when people make this into an overally gendered issue.Also, the career vs family aspect applies again to both parties. Men who are very career-orientated miss out on some fundamental aspects of family life, and same appliese for women. Again, people are irritated because Simmon's ignores reality, instead just to focus on largely sexist arguments.Also, most men don't buy ""mansions"" to get sex. Unless they're complete idiots, it's cheaper to buy a hooker if you have that amount of money. People buy mansions to brag/show off or because they think they're in love and want to impress.

You have men saying the exact same shit about ""producing and protecting their healthy offspring with younger females"" now ages 10-14 , yet they still impregnate and ditch the offspring on them if given the chance.5). You have women dressing sexy and faking pregnancies to attract and use a man for financial gain. Men and women today will give up a perfectly genetic partner for trash. Today,an older stronger man can find a young woman and she'll be the only reason his friends come over and ain't no telling if the offspring will be his after that.  The whole ""she'll produce strong offspring"" or ""he'll protect the kids"" mentality high likely never even crossed couples minds. You don't see most couples today asking for more children after 4 regardless of strong genes. And the mom has to play a hand in protecting the children whether the man is there or not, because it's called being a parent/guardian. I wouldn't get with a woman who'd rely on me entirely to protect the kids and sit there If a dog is mauling one when I'm inable. I'm not attracted to sexy younger woman either, only mature. Yes woman do dress to attract males,but not all of them. You sure in hell can't say that about pre-adolescents on the beach in baiting suits. Just because they show skin shouldn't make that an invitation.Just like a woman who dress nicely for a funeral is paying respect for a lost one not trying to attract them.

Celebrity/media world is the only place where what he describes does not work, so the panel is worng because the ""discussions"" over celebrity scandals have nothing to do with it, and he is wrong because if you have a skyscraper you are not affected by that system. But in the normal population, it is women who have a full control over almost all interpersonal relationships. Women literally decide which men are allowed into the society and which are expelled and bullied for being ugly. In the same time, for clear demographic reasons (male to female ratio at birth is about 105:100),  even the ugliest women can have partners and live normal lives. Yes, being an attractive woman brings some amount of unwanted attention, but the benefits are gigantic - never having to be or having to deal with anything alone, always and having a safe cussion to fall to, having an unconditional and automatic protection in the society. It is not a zero-sum game, being attractive is insanely advantageous, and being a woman is usually advatageous too in the same sense to a lesser degree. Also, being an unattractive man is incomparably worse than being an unattractive woman - the men are redundant and vast majority of the society agrees that they deserve to be ostracised. By the way, the hourly wage gap between attractive and unattractive people is several times higher than between men and women. And even if women still make less yearly than men (which is not even true under the age of 30 now), attractive women will, on average, have partners who have much more money; so their standard of living is usually way higher than that of any men who does a similar job as she does.I wish women (and attractive men as well, for that matter) could try to live as a man from the ugliest 5% for some time. All of you would immediately stop complaining about your lives, and you would also immediately understand why young men commit so many times more suicides than young women.

You become more ruthless then everyone else and you don't spare a thought for anyone's feelings or how people judge you. Power is rarely given up without a big fight. It's true, the majority of people on the planet with real power are men and yes, they don't want to give any of that power to women ... they also don't want to give any of it to other men either ... in fact they usually want to take it from the other people (mostly men) with power. Power is almost never in the hands of someone who really cares about the people around them or who wants to share that power. Just look at the history of Communism to see that a system that was designed to be open and where power and wealth are shared, turned into a dictatorship within seconds of existing. You know why? Because it takes one person ... one ruthless, power hungry person to bring it down and you'll find many more than one willing to put themselves ahead of everyone else. Until there's an actual paradigm shift in humans, the change you all want is impossible ... from the left or the right. Progressives will have to fight for the change they want and half of the world will fight back with all their might ... blood will be spilled. You just can't change someone's mind by ordering them to change their mind ... or making it a law. *Especially in the US, you need to stop fighting the ""Pro-Noun"" and ""Patriarchy"" stuff where it's about hurt feelings, and start taking money out of politics so you can have a system of government that's not controlled by those ruthless few who have real power. Then maybe there might be a power shift. *Note: I am not saying that women aren't/shouldn't be equal to men or that any violence against LGBT Community is ok. You should have laws against that sort of stuff like all western democracies ... you just need them enforced. I'd also like to point out that the natural progress we western democracies have made over the last 100 years is impressive. Sure it would have been better if 100 years ago we all decided to change our laws on voting rights for classes, women, indigenous people and minorities ... equality in the work force .... equal pay ... segregation ... equal marriage rights etc. but for change to last in a democracy, it needs the majority to agree and changing minds is a slower process in these democracies then it would be if you had a dictatorship.

UgwS_bU3u4bretBshEZ4AaABAg,Kyle Kimble,1 month ago,1.51E+12,"Let me preface this by saying, I like TYT, but I honestly wish there was a man on this panel. This entire segment comes off as a reactionary assessment of Gene's comments with little attempt at understanding the view point (Ana got it a little). It just seemed like a bunch of 3rd wave feminist buzz words thrown out there with the, ""this is offensive to me"", and this is ""offensive to people I don't even represent"" (men) cherry thrown on top.Gene has a hyperbolic and clunky way of explaining the real world dynamic between sexes, but it's nonetheless real. He's not exactly suggesting that a woman wear a potato sack, or that she has to actually ""lift and separate them""... and not actually suggesting that a man has to build a sky scraper to impress women. He's saying that if a woman really dressed down she'd truly see how quickly all those helping hands, some opportunities and a lot of fawning men would disappear (effectively losing some power in the world), and that men as a whole can't simply dress up and look attractive and achieve that same pull... That they have to actually have something else to offer such as accomplishments, money, or intellect (metaphorical skyscrapers) to get what they want in this world.The reason it comes off as a dumb and primitive power dynamic comment, is because that's exactly what it is... PRIMITIVE. A dynamic that's has been around since the dawn of man, and in many instances shows in the animal kingdom as well.While the majority of men aren't raping women in the streets because of how they look, the majority of men are swayed and can be manipulated by a ""pretty face"". By that we simply mean someone who they are attracted to. It causes a power dynamic that gives women a natural power over men and a natural power in the world. Many studies have shown that we treat people who we deem as attractive, nicer... And that this in turn causes us to do more things for that individual.Men are very ""visual creatures"". That's not to belittle or ""offend"" men as this panel seems to suggest a statement of that Ilk would do. It's simply true. If a woman is attractive to a man, she holds a certain power over him.

What he pointed out is that women basically have an unfair advantage when it comes using your 'looks' to gain power. The same way men have an unfair advantage with let's say upper body strength, he is (badly) just pointing out that you do have that power and btw I am sure that the women lower in trait agreeableness will understand and most likely already be using this, to the other women more power to you for trying to play a fair-ish game. The group talked about women who used that unfair advantage being slandered when they do use it. (duh, it's an unfair advantage! of course, people won't want you to use it)  It's the same reason people dislike white privilege it's because it's only accessible to white people! Look. if guys could use their looks to get to the top of societal hierarchies I can guarantee you they would.Looking at the numbers make everything so much simpler, let's all also take a step back and remember that we are basically only smart oil monkeys half a chromosome away from chimps.Here's what I'm putting forward, societies selectively breed for traits that benefit said society.

Simply put successful guys get laid!

Ugw0zH8-KKQWuJyag_14AaABAg,Philip Wayne,1 month ago,1.51E+12,"Ugh. This video has so many issues with it and strangely doesnï¿_Ûªt have Hannah Cranston in it. The woman in the middle seems to want to find a way to throw every third wave feminist buzzword and talking point into this conversation. They all miss the point except Ana borders on getting it but doesnï¿_Ûªt quite make it.I have no real opinion on Kiss or Gene Simmons, but I at least understand what he is trying to convey. It is clunky and horribly worded, but it is not wrong. He is talking about power through manipulation. A pretty face will get more views on average than an ugly or even average face. Itï¿_Ûªs not the Patriarchy. It is not framing it that men have all the power, although his clunkiness makes it almost sound that way. He uses poor metaphors and a lot of people get stuck on attacking his metaphor rather than understanding what he means by it. He is not talking about literal ï¿_ï¿_ï¿_potato sacksï¿_Ûù and ï¿_ï¿_ï¿_sky scrapersï¿_Ûù, he means ï¿_ï¿_ï¿_dressed downï¿_Ûù or a ï¿_ï¿_ï¿_thrown together lookï¿_Ûù and accomplishments. His arguments are obviously from an older generation world view but still have relevance today.Power is a social construct at least in the terms he is talking about. We only have power when other people give us that power. As an example, money is a form of power. Money itself is about worthless until we as a society say it has value. If I want more of this power, I can rob a bank or I can produce a product or idea and sell it. Stick with legal means, to sell a product or idea, I need to have a market. Some people might have a natural need or want, but if I want to sell more I need to manipulate people into thinking they need or want it. I ï¿_ï¿_ï¿_pretty it upï¿_Ûù and advertise it to sell more. This is the core of what he is saying. It is not really about gender specifically. Again he words it clunky and has that older generational view that rides hard on gender stereotypes like men only looking at physical attractiveness and women only looking at the pocket books.I personally am not against feminism. I think there are huge problems with modern feminism that mostly have to do with people who donï¿_Ûªt understand their cause or ideas but think they do. I am in favor of equality but I mean true equality, not the stereotyped one-sided version of it. I donï¿_Ûªt care what human line it crosses, if you are a human you should be treated loosely the same. There is no such thing as perfect equality, but we can and should get as close to it as we can. That having been said, ï¿_ï¿_ï¿_mansplainingï¿_Ûù is not a thing and a terrible word and argument. If you are trying to combat sexism with sexism, you missed the point. Yes some men are terrible with assumptions and some men are jerks, but corralling these bad, misguided, or thoughtless individuals and making a blanket sexist term that covers the majority of everyone on the other side is just bad for any reasonable dialogue. As a guy I have had many things ï¿_ï¿_ï¿_mansplainedï¿_Ûù to me. Some people start an explanation and canï¿_Ûªt stop themselves until the argument is out of there head regardless of knowledge demonstration or acknowledgement. This is not a man exclusive phenomenon, women do it as well.The patriarchy is not a thing, at least not in the United States. There are some older generational hold-outs who donï¿_Ûªt think women should have rights or power, there are some bad people, but there is not an overbearing active effort to keep women down. Womenï¿_Ûªs rights are a relatively new thing. There are a LOT or people who are alive from a time that fight was fought. People generally resist change, particularly if it is pushed on them against their beliefs. It sucks but it is like that on everything. When a woman gets denied something they should have gotten by qualifications, there could be another issue involved (personality unfortunately matter) or that manager might just be a bad person. No conspiracy, no legal groundwork, just a jerk.The wage gap has been debunked so many times, I donï¿_Ûªt even feel I should engage in it. Again it is not that there is nothing to it, but the 77 cents argument is blatantly wrong.",6,FALSE,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.943

We saw that with the concept of aristocracy - how useless people were in positions of authority on account of the deluded concept of nobility. At first the system of aristocracy came under attack via despotic means of varying degrees, and some aristocrats may have been treated unjustly themselves, victims of inverted snobbery. But no one's arguing that the system of meritocracy should be abolished - and we return to automatic privilege due to blood-line. So in the initial stage of feminism there may be inverted snobbery, some low-level feminist despotism  - and perhaps a few men will fall victim - but the general thrust of feminism will be progressive. And the countries that stick to irrational prejudices to protect ancient privileges - will fall behind. Naturally if you are protecting a lot of useless men - and baring more talented women from replacing them, you are actually holding back creativity and 'healthy' competition. For instance, Serena Williams might be in the top 100 tennis players in the world, meaning she could beat most professional male tennis players, so there's men in that top 100 on false premises - merely there because of their gender and gender apartheid.

Do you have any actual sources for this or are you just making stuff up? More likely it's other women somewhere along the cause of feminism that have 'brainwashed' their counterparts into thinking that using their beauty to get what they are after is beneath them. Probably because in many ways they are right; the only way that works is in a world where men alone have the resources to provide, and in a changing world that is becoming less and less relevant. Simply using looks and charm to barter a husband and gain a lifestyle is an archaic tradition that is not something we encourage in women today. Therefore, an insinuation that we should be doing this can be insulting, and harks back to a time when women had less power within the workings of the country. Not to mention, we have been competing for resources since we climbed out of the ocean, rivalry is still a very powerful motivator for unjustified disapproval. I don't believe men are very much involved in this changing structure within the female sex - the evidence being while women have made a dramatic change to their roles in society over the last 100 years, men have stayed much more static (Not in every sense, but on average and in comparison) - so the idea that they could have influenced it much I think is flat wrong, you may have been doing some trial and error when it comes to getting laid, but you're talking about the inner workings of a woman's mind and how she interprets life and her role in it.

He states that women dressing in a certain way gives them the power to stimulate men and that men don't have the power to do the same. The first part, that women can sexually stimulate men through the way they dress, is true, but where he is wrong is the second part, that men can't sexually stimulate women in the same manner. Just go to a beach and look around and you can find a large amount of guys who are muscular and ripped walking around shirtless. Believe it or not, women are into that sort of thing.It also is important to analyze intent. Specifically, the reason he is bringing up this false premise. Pardon my speculation, but I believe he's bringing it up to justify why women are being disproportionately targeted by sexual crimes, claiming that because women dress provocatively, they stimulate men and are therefore given what they are asking for, and since men can't sexually stimulate women, men aren't targeted in the same way. I could be wrong, and I'm entirely willing to be proven otherwise on this point, but needless to say, this would also be untrue since men do have the capacity to sexually stimulate women. Also, if we do follow this logic, then we come to the conclusion that women should dress modestly if they don't want to stimulate men and be targeted by sexual assault. I don't know about you, but I rather enjoy having women around who where booty shorts, short skirts, cleavage showing attire, and ect. Lets be honest, the world would suck if America was like Saudi Arabia where women were all forced to cover themselves and wear Burkas to avoid sexual assault, which is why I think he is wrong.

The issue is, often times people abuse their power, especially in the cases of Harvey Weinstien, Roy Moore, Roger Ailes, Bill Oriely, and ect to get sexual acts from women.
