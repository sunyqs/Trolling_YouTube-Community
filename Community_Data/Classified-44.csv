Not everyone shares your past or the past of your people.  Like the trump family and a majority of US are legal immigrants.  Who do not share your sordid history and could care less.""  

You erased this comment but I'm gonna reply to it, anyway.  First of all, you don't know if any of this is my history or not.  You don't know if I'm an illegal immigrant or if my history involves being lynched which is why you're shooting in the dark.  But what I will say is that, it's easy not to care, until the same discrimination and persecution based on the color of your skin, alone, is knocking on your door and if you aren't a WASP and with people like Trump in the office, it could easily be so, at some point (actually, it already is so).  What happens when an ignorant white supremacist/racist mistakes you for being Mexican because you have tanned skin like some of them and attempts to kill you or sexually assault your women?  What happens when your women are mistaken for being Muslim or Arab and are targeted for racial attacks because of that?  What happens when they call your children racially charged names in school and beat them up because they aren't white like them?  What happens when you don't get the job because a bunch of white people applied for the job and white is always right?  This is why anyone who isn't a WASP or lily white should care about white supremacy/racism, both in the past and in the present.  The past does inform the present and future.  You are aware of this, right?  Even ""whites"" should care about it.  Irish people and Italians were once not considered ""white"" and there is still a racial hierarchy in place in the West, even among supposed ""whites.""  It's not a coincidence that Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy are at the bottom in Europe, following Russia and all of ""Eastern"" Europe (clever way to separate the inferior whites from the real whites).  Also, ever see a tanned skinned Italian in The White House or as president?  I didn't think so.  Also, imagine if white supremacists got their way and wiped out all humans of African descent.  Who do you think would become the new Africans and slaves?  And nothing you said had anything to do with my original point and I brought up African Americans being lynched (some people are still alive today who lived through these times) to show that these white supremacists crying about being persecuted for being white, is nothing but lies, propaganda and mythology on their part.  Whites have NEVER had to worry about being lynched, anywhere, EVER just because they were seen as inferior based on the color of their skin, especially not by anyone of color, including African Americans.  That's what you call persecution, not being called a frickin' ""racist"" by oppressed, marginalized groups you're responsible for oppressing and there are many in every group who think the white persecution complex is bunk, even other whites.  Also, if you cared so little, you wouldn't have commented in the first place.  I bet you care about the Jews and their Holocaust, even if it did happen decades ago and if you do but don't care about others who've went through things, similar, just because it was in the past, doesn't that make you a hypocrite and well, racist?",0,/Negative/Worry/,Negative,0.658,Worry,0.241

That guy was from The New Black Panther Party, which has no affiliation with the Original Black Panther Party, and they are considered a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.  There are literally six times more pro-white, pro-christian, anti-gay, anti-muslim groups in America than there are pro black groups and that's just the groups.  Go to the Souther Poverty Law Center's hate map, and tell me which groups appear to be the most threatening in terms of location.

Your initial statement says a group like this makes the alt-right, but no, that's not true.  The New Black Panther Party was established in the 80s as an attempt to revive the original black panther party (which was shut down by the U.S. government because governments can be racist, too), but being extremists because it felt the original party wasn't aggressive enough against white people.  The original black panther party supported poor people regardless of race with their lunch program, but also lawfully protected black neighborhoods.

The Alt-Right came into existence as a group for a number of reasons: It did not feel like republicans were far enough to the right, it hated the fact this country elected a black president, it did not cope well with decreasing numbers of whites in America, didn't like seeing jewish people taking power previously held by rich whites, as well as these people wanting to go back to a time where there were 30% more whites which also meant 60% harsher racism.  They talk about the fact that they are discriminated against but they are merely feeling that way because they see whites are losing power in numbers (which to them, is ""racist"" when it's not.)

In short you have it backwards: black racism was a response to white racism.  White racism has always been a proactive movement of hating other races for not being white.  They are all stupid because hate does not destroy hate.",0,/Negative/Hate/,Negative,0.803,Hate,0.266

I understand the history of the alt right and the new black panthers, that little synopsis was not needed.  And no, black racism is not spawned in response to white racism, while white racism is born from ignorance and hatred.  They both are born from ignorance and hatred, and most importantly, the flawed perception of victimization. That was the entire point of the clip.   Black supremecists exist. Pro-black, alt-black, whatever you want to call them, they exist.  And pointing to the amount of non violent groups like christian anti gay picket sign holders doesnt make the death toll go down.  Black violence against whites exists in far greater numbers both in total and therefore per capita than the reverse. It is not unreasonable, considering the amount of assumption of motive that goes into analyising police use of force, judicial policies, ""hate incidents"" marked as facts by the splc, etc. To suggest that a statistically significant number of these crimes are hate crimes that are racially motivated, and not just the ones that are recorded as such. I was a victim of one myself.  But because the attackers went through my pockets after assaulting me and yelling racial slurs, the police called it robbery. The splc also deemed kek and pepe the frog hate symbols, and their claim that hate crimes have risen since trump are majority based off of unconfirmed, self reported incidents at elementary schools.  If this amount of assumption is given to them, snd people who claim shootings like tamir rice were racially motivated, isnt it only fair to assume that if a white person is mercilessly beaten by one or more black people that it might have some racial hostility to it?  What is important is which of these hate groups listed and which groups people openly call for and commit acts of violence and bloody, unjustified revolution in response to fake victimization.  Which of these hate groups are responsible for more death?  You use the splc (a liberal biased agenda driven thinktank) hate map to determine how much racism and racial violence is happening in america.

When a Muslim commits a terrorists attack IN THE NAME OF ISLAM, then it's perfectly logical to blame ISLAM, not Muslims. Do you understand the difference?  You see, ISLAM is a religion, MUSLIMS are people who believe in said religion. Islam (at least several sects of it) is a terrible ideology that demands submission from everyone (that's what ""Islam"" literally means: ""submission."").

white race have found new racists to carry the torch (literally) and their beliefs into the 21st century.
Implies Taylor is a Nazi

And considering Taylor’s fan base is mostly young girls, does the song also serve as indoctrination into white supremacy? 
It is hard to believe that Taylor had no idea that the lyrics of her latest single read like a defense of white privilege and white anger — specifically, white people who feel that they are being left behind as other races and groups start to receive dignity and legally recognized rights. “We will not be replaced” and “I don’t like your kingdom keys” are not different in tone or message. Both are saying that whites feel threatened and don’t want to share their privilege. And there is no way to know for sure if Taylor is a Trump supporter or identifies with the white nationalist message, but her silence has not gone unnoticed.

Utter BS

It implies that she suposedly Taylored her songs to fit NeoNazi Bullshit

/

And like the quiet support that Trump received to the surprise of polls, Democrats, and the world, Taylor is giving support to the white nationalist movements through lyrics that speak to their anger, entitlement, and selfishness.
That's Clearly an Aligation

Deranged part >

When Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and Beyonce openly campaigned for Hillary Clinton, Taylor’s political silence appeared to be a rejection of her peers’ support of the inclusive Democrat platform. And when one of the most popular female artists in the world declines to join the many in her field in voicing for progressive politics, it could well be construed as her lending support to the voices rising against embracing diversity and inclusion emblematic of Trump supporters.

All of this clearly pressing on the line between idiot commentary and making stuff up. 

.
And Finally Really
 > And now that they feel empowered, it befits the movement to have a white, blonde, conservative pop star that has no doubt been “bullied” by people of color in the media, singing their feelings out loud. And with a president that openly addresses hate groups and justifies racial hatred, this is not a time for neutrality.
And while pop musicians are not respected world leaders, they have a huge audience and their music often reflects their values. So Taylor’s silence is not innocent, it is calculated. And if that is not true, she needs to state her beliefs out loud for the world — no matter what fan base she might lose, because in America 2017, silence in the face of injustice means support for the oppressor.",2,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/Hate/,Negative,0.535,Hate,0.255

An aspiring mistress of sexual spectacle,
She only wants to perform a respectable
Part in the pantheon of the perfectible
Idols of glamour and show.

Molting her vestments, she enters the manic scene
Chanting her mantras from dramas and magazines,
Dancing with cameras and light in a frantic dream,
Chasing down fame’s flitting glow.

Buoyed by worship, she reaches her pinnacle,
Making her prey to the hostile and cynical.
Parasite acolytes seal her within a cool
Lithograph, capturing her form.

Now her friends gaze on her, never to talk or stay.
Lovers turned liars by avarice walk away
Leaving her: only a little girl locked away
Far from all softness and warmth.

High on her mount she looks ever more fearfully
Out from behind a façade crafted carefully,
Hiding all sutures lest they start to tear, fully
Severing prosthetic appeal.

Knowing she’s mortal, she clutches her offerings,
Using diversions and opiates to mend her seams,
Salving her doom with a mordant of self-extreme,
Never again to be real.

Just because they call themselves ""Anti-Fascist"" doesn't mean they are in fact anti-fascist, any more than Muslims calling Islam a religion of peace makes Islam a religion of peace. It's a confusing little Marxist trick they use to obfuscate the truth and confuse the enemy. In psychology it's called ""projection"". I accuse you of the very thing that I am guilty of in order to get ahead of you when you try to call me on it. It's so baffling that it usually works. Just at the moment that I am about to reveal you as a thief, you accuse me of stealing the silverware, take all the wind out of my sails, and make me look like a six-year-old screaming, ""No, you're the thief!"". Very clever. The Quran describes it in detail... In short, ""Antifa"" are a bunch of fascists.

In Iran, the leftists and the Jihadists joined forces against the establishment then fought it out amongst themselves after the Shah had been deposed. The Jihadists, of course, executed all the ""useful idiot"" leftist and the rest is history. Similarly, Antifa and other left wing groups naturally form alliances with Jihadists because they share most of the same enemies and are more similar than even they know. On the surface it appears improbable that leftists and Muslim fundamentalists would work together because of such obvious differences as woman's rights and homosexual rights, until you realize that the leftists don't actually care about the things they pretend to care about. In the words of Saul Alinsky, ""The 'issue' is never the issue. The revolution is always the issue.""

Like it or not there is a Leftist/Muslim axis and they are trying to take over the world. They are apparently happy to fight amongst themselves over our remains once they've murdered us all.

I don't think we can understand how many lies are reported about celebrities, some celebrities will go after all the news articles, some don't pay attention to it or call them out and some only take legal action when it's incredibly defamatory, and I do think calling somebody a nazi and putting nazi imagery in their views falls under the defamatory category. The journalist had no concrete evidence apart from social media posts from soppy leftist twats on twitter, yet they won't go after actual racists, Nazi's and generally bad people.

My point is if somebody says something disgusting and false about all you have to do is argue back,  just because someone says something that doesn’t mean everyone will believe it.

Beatrice Borromeo is a reporter who has worked with Newsweek and the Daily Beast and went to the University of Milan just as Milan is connected with the media. Milan is considered a major international media center and the name Milan is believed to derive from the word Mediolanum. Princess Beatrice Borromeo married Pierre Casiraghi of the House of Hanover and House of Grimaldi and he is the major shareholder for a construction company and helicopter company. Donna Lavinia Borromeo is married to John Elkann who is Chairman of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles which includes Alfa Romeo. John Elkann is the grandson of Gianni Agnelli. Alfa Romeo has a serpent eating a child as their logo and the company was founded in Milan. Donna Matilde Borromeo married to Prince Antonius zu Furstenberg. The Furstenberg family are another very powerful bloodline. Prince Egon von Furstenberg marred Clara Agnelli of the Agnelli family which founded Fiat and their son is Prince Alexander von Furstenberg a businessman who is on the Board of Directors for IAC. These families are all highly criminal. Prince Vitaliano XI is the head of the Borromeo family today.",1,true,1,,,,,,,/Negative/Worry/,Negative,0.378,Worry,0.231

I agree with the importance of a bit of what you said, to be fair, and I'll add that I'd like to see some of those topics covered by new angles.
