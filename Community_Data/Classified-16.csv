It's clear to me that he wasn't just joking around, he had a thing for this woman.  She spoke of him later treating her badly during that time, because she'd rebuffed him...  Being someone who has been violated in various gradations of this (btw, I liked what Mark said on this), from indisputably criminal to ""was that really assault?,"" the thing that comes to mind in this moment is how the problem is that most men just don't get it.  They think, hell, they'd love it if a woman touched them in a sexual way.  They don't understand the fuss, it's just sex shrugs don't you like sex?  It isn't sex.  It's all about the power, overpowering a woman.  It's about degrading a woman, generally disrespecting women.  Additionally, many women who are violated in this way were also molested as a child.  Somehow subconsciously we create it.  So we re-experience the horror of feeling violated, powerless, betrayed ... and you have this overwhelming energy to strike back. Where a man could successfully do so, a woman has to just carry it with her through the rest of her life...and then often express it in various self-destructive ways.  Yes, it can be soul-killing for a woman.  And one poignant knife twist is when others make excuses for the motherf*cker.  ""Oh, he didn't mean anything by it"" or ""He's just old"" or ""He was just joking around"" ...  I've had an obese male employer rub is effin' gut on the back of my head while I sat at my desk.  In confronting him, he acted like he was numb or something in his stomach (he wasn't)...and he later repeated it.  In a retail job when I was in my 20's, this one old guy who spoke with an artificial voice box, would come in and corner the young women and hug them tightly.  He was using his pathetic-ness to get away with violating women in this way.  I usually managed to evade him, but he finally cornered me one day.  I felt violated, so very angry.  And to make it so much worse, in complaining about it to others, they just made excuses for him.  Society allows it, facilitates it, there are no consequences.  If you tell a man there are piranhas in some water he's about to dive into, do ya' think he'll jump in?

Misreading a situation totally where a kiss is SCRIPTED was -as it turned out - totally a misjudgement on a large scale, but not even close to real sexual abuse. Making that ""funny photo"" where he does not even touch breasts, is MASSIVELY stupid and part of a totally not funny  situation, but where no one got harmed. Except when the picture was actually released.That Mr. Franken apologizes is totally correct. He should. And he should also be ashamed. But this is not a massive case of sexual abuse where he should be considered a sexual predator unfit for his job, or anything of the sort. Focusing on this case makes it feel like maybe all male attention towards women potentially is sexual abuse, and then the very term sexual abuse lose it's meaning.That is way worse than male humour sometimes being totally misappropriate.I know of many women who have conducted themselves ""abusive"" towards men in similar situations. But indeed there are abuse and there are ""abuse"".Edit: Also, failing to see the true gradation here (even if it is talked somewhat about in this segment) costs liberals a LOT of votes (not only in the Franken case, but overall)  - the other side do not care about even intentional sexual abuse over years and concerning minors.

I wish he had realized she was speaking as a person who wanted no contact as opposed to an actor disagreeing artistically.To call it harassment is still up in the air for me. I say that because I know the world of improv and performance writing/creation. In the heat of hammering out the idea, one can be convinced something is funny/integral to the storyline and another can disagree strongly. Often, it takes trying it to see if it works. That often occurs when the ���nay�۝ side is ���naying�۝ their loudest. The ���yay�۝ side will just do it, everyone sees clearly if it fits, one side relents immediately, and the troupe moves ahead. It saves time and settles the argument. And it is rather an unspoken understanding (up to a certain point) in physical comedy. One kiss would normally be in the green zone, though type of kiss and context could put it in the yellow. Further than that, they would replace the protesting actor with someone willing to try. The protesting actor can then see for themselves.The problem here is that it did involve a kiss and an actor who not only disagreed with the plot line, she could not separate herself from the role and she really loathed the thought of kissing Franken. As a community performer, I stay away from parts where I must be affectionate because I can�۪t separate myself enough from the role. I know that about myself and have not sought advanced experience when I could have because of that. In the world of acting, you must be able to separate yourself from the character and not personalize it. Of course, when it comes to sexual scenes, an actor has it legally written into contracts. But not with something like one kiss.I often look at some of the things they do on SNL  (kissing, fake making out, icky tongue twirling, cupping hands over breasts, etc.) and wonder how they do that without breaking character. I�۪ve watched Jon Hamm & Jason Sudeikis plant big kisses on each other and both are straight. Kate McKinnon and Larry David recently did this icky two drunks gross French kissing thing. Not only is she gay, she could be his granddaughter. The skits are funny with the shock value, but I always wonder how they are able to separate themselves. But that is only because I am bad at it myself. So I can totally get Franken�۪s mindset. He was used to working with professional actors who just tried whatever to get the laugh. They have made that separation in their minds and would viewed Franken�۪s actions as part of the creative process. He would not have been viewed to be predatory whatsoever.The way one knows the kiss was not predatory is because there was no persistence. There was no talk other than the skit itself. She pushed and he didn�۪t push back, dig in his heels or harden his stance. He took it as a push, as a full stop. At that point, the fourth wall was broken & he knew it was more than artistic differences. And he didn�۪t persist.Franken worked with comedic greats such a Jane Curtin, Lorraine Newman & Gilda Radnor. Just LOOK at some of the bawdy things these actors did. Yet none of them ever accused Akroyd, Murray, Belushi, Franken, etc., of misconduct. Why? Because there is a contextual bubble.This woman claims she is being blamed for the backlash. I do not blame her whatsoever. I do, however, view THIS instance as a cultural clash. Two people coming from different cultures hit a brick wall. I do understand her feelings. But I also think that if she was an Amy Poehler, Kate McKinnon or Lorraine Newman, she�۪d be laughing at the photo and the kiss wouldn�۪t even be in her memory. Now, it would be different had Franken done something like Louis CK or Weinstein, like fondling himself or asking her to do so.

His apology was couched with the ""I don't remember it that way"" excuse.The Moore guy who denies the allegations is put under pressure to drop out of a political race.We don't know if Mr Moore is guilty or not of anything. If he hasn't done as alleged then there is no reason why he should drop out. Maybe politically it is bad for hair party but if you have a standard that candidates must drop out if sexual allegations are made then you find that will lead to problems in the long run.

An assault can be anything from a punch in the face to touching someone on the shoulder, as long as the contact happened without the consent (permission) of the person being touched. The important thing is not the amount of force used, but whether the touching was allowed and whether it was intended. An assault can also happen when someone makes any gesture or action which makes another person feel a reasonable apprehension of harm. There does not need to be any touching for this type of assault to occur. For example, if someone is pointing their finger in another person�۪s face and they feel that they are going to be assaulted, an assault may have occurred. Assault also occurs when a person who is carrying or wearing a visible weapon, stops another person, harasses them or begs them for something. Section 2 of the Criminal Code defines ���weapon�۝ as anything a person uses or means to use to cause someone fear, to harm or to kill. This includes any guns, knives or other object which could be used as a weapon. ^TOP^IntentionA person has to mean to touch or alarm someone else for an assault to happen. Accidentally bumping into someone, if they do not mean to bump into that other person, is not an assault. Also, if someone is waving their finger at someone else, but do not mean to alarm them, then they have not committed an assault.  ^TOP^Consent1. IntroductionFor an assault to occur, the person who has been touched must not have agreed to the contact. If consent is found, then no assault has occurred. Consent is an important part in many activities which involve touching. For example, in a hockey game, the players have consented to the touching that occurs between them during a game. So, if a hockey player injures someone, the player has not committed an assault because the injured player agreed to play the game which involved some danger of being hurt or injured. The injuries must be those that are expected in any hockey game; if they are more serious, then it might be assault since a hockey player does not consent to anything outside of the normal rules and risks of the game.  ** NOTE: Consent is invalid when adults cause non-trivial bodily harm (fist fight or brawl), and intended to cause the harm. ** Has there been consent?Whether or not there is consent depends on the facts of the situation. In a trial, the Crown (the prosecution) must prove that the person who was assaulted did not consent to being touched. Consent can be either express, which means the person who was touched actually said they could be touched, or implied, which means the person who was touched showed by their actions that the touching was OK. It must be reasonable that there was actually consent. It may be implied that the touching was consensual if, in the facts of the situation, the reasonable person would assume that consent had been given. However, for consent to be implied the facts must give some support to the accused�۪s belief that they had consent. DrunkennessIf an individual is drunk and assaults someone on purpose, they are not excused just because they were drunk when it happened. As a matter of public policy, people will generally not be allowed to use drunkenness as a defence to an intentional assault. When is consent NOT given?A person has not given consent to being touched if they merely went along with what someone was doing because they were threatened or otherwise scared. Just because someone has not said ""no"" does not mean they have consented. A person also has not given consent in these specific examples. If the accused has hurt, or says they will hurt, someone else.  This third person can be someone the person being assaulted does or does not know.If the accused lies to the person they assault about what the real activity is that the person is consenting to.If the accused lies to a person about who they really are so they can get that person�۪s consent.If the accused uses a position of authority to coerce someone into consenting.  Examples of relationships of authority are those between teachers and students, doctors and patients and lawyers and clients. When injuries caused by the assault are non-trivial. In these situations, no consent will be found in law no matter what the accused believed to be true.  """,0,/Negative/,Negative,0.9

It's so vague that literally any gesture can be called ""assault"" if the ""victim"" claims they were threatened by it (though it seems they would have to prove intent).This doesn't mean that pointing at someone is illegal per se, just that it can be under relatively rare circumstances. *A person has to mean to touch or alarm someone else for an assault to happen.

However, in THIS context of comedy, satire, improv and hyperbole, I can completely see where a seasoned comedian like Franken would push the envelope for a heightened laugh WITHOUT it being a sexual thing at all and with him believing if he demonstrated an exaggerated, gross kiss, she and everyone else would get the comedic point.I�۪m saying this as one who has watched SNL through the years and also knows something about the improv comedy process. Just a few weeks ago, Kate McKinnon & Larry David were in a skit where the joke was about strangers hooking up at a bar. McKinnon has done this character before & it�۪s always this icky, but hilarious schtick with over the top tongue twirling, etc. There have multiple sketches like this, even where actors cup another�۪s breasts (the Cat Adoption skits with Wiig & McKinnon ��� Tiffany Haddish just did it last week). This has been the case since the show started back in the 1970�۪s and it�۪s that bubble from which Franken hails. In this case, I could totally see where it�۪s a clash of cultures: his being comedy improv and hers being military.Now, had he blocked her from leaving or pushed back and forcibly pursued her or had he exposed himself, requested she pleasure him or threaten her job if she wouldn�۪t ���give it up�۝ (as per other Hollywood elites), that would be another thing.

Ugz9hJUnjpqmM_wtEfd4AaABAg,PasswordSuck777,1 month ago,1.511E+12,"As i said before, if everyone who had to kiss someone on stage as part of a script, which they agreed to, hated their experience afterwards and considered it ""sexual abuse"" we wouldn't hear the end of it. I'm entirely neutral on Al Franken as a person and i think it's great that women are coming forward and demanding justice, but this particular case is just beyond ridiculous. First of all, she consented to it, even though she hated it. He didn't force himself onto her, blame the script he wrote if anything. She could have said no and somebody else could have volunteered to do it. To compare his isolated case with the likes of Weinstein, Spacey and even Moore or Trump, sets a dangerous precedent as to what is considered ""sexual assault."" There needs to be proper distinctions between offenses and what Al did not only happened years ago, but is nowhere close to actual victims of sexual assault. She willingly participated in it, kissed him and hated her experience so much she was traumatized by it. He didn't pursue her afterwards and he probably didn't even know how awful it was for her. The picture used as ""evidence"" against him is a dumb joke which, to anyone who knows camera angles and perspective, clearly shows that he's not even touching her....Like i said, i don't care about Al Franken, but as more allegations come to light, we need to make clear distinctions between cases. Franken apologized and she accepted it. Should he lose his job over it? Absolutely not. If we all dig up old skeletons based on bad experiences we once had with someone, which isn't even anywhere near actual sexual assault, we're just muddying the water and ruining people's lives over petty nonsense. As long as they apologize for whatever it is they were accused of in those cases, can we just all move on with our lives as they did and should? To hell with people like Weinstein, Spacey, Moore and even Trump, but let's be logical about this before we just all point the finger at each other and make mountains out of very little. Let's be sensible over those issues, before innocents get hurt as well, not just those who are really guilty.Now if more allegations come out against him, then yes, consider him as guilty depending on said offenses, but as it stand, it's far from being enough to be considered ""sexual assault"" on a despicable level such as the recent cases we've seen so far. Even Louis CK was more disgusting and i consider his case more as dumb indecent exposure than anything else, which made him look like a perverted idiot, but he never ""groped"" anyone or ""jumped on them like a bitch.""PS: I already posted this on Emma's video on the subject, but it needs to be said, before innocent lives get ruined in the process, as we fail to properly categorize offenses and paint every cases with the same brush. Not only is it, as i said, a dangerous precedent, but involving actual innocents in the mix is doing a disservice to those who were actually raped, sexually abused and now live with those trauma. Be logical people, be sensible, before those who less deserve it get hurt and those who seek to abuse the system get away with it. I applaud those coming forward, but there will be abuse and false allegations as well, that's part of human nature. We need to do right by people, but also those we can wrongfully vilify as the situation gets out of hand. We need to do everything we can to make sure the right people get what they deserve and, if possible, attribute proper justice to the victims of sexual assaults. Not just accuse each other over lesser offenses.",0,FALSE,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.879

If a woman is able to ""take back"" her consent to an agreed upon action 11 years later, then any man that isn't a virgin is going to be vulnerable to a charge of some kind of sexual assault. That means that any guy can be arbitrarily accused of heinous shit at any given time. It's a dynamic like that (lots of powerful men able to be accused at any time of serious crimes because laws/ethical standards were murky) that allowed Putin to gain power in Russia after he took down oligarch opponents in the media in the early 2000s.

We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth""2. He said in his apology his account of what happened was different from hers, he didn't admit to assaulting her.3. The picture of him pretending to grope her she was wearing a military vest the equivalent of having a pillow over your chest and he wasn't even really touching her. It was a joke, maybe in poor taste but non the less a joke.The first point is a direct quote from her saying she said ok so he'd stop bothering her about a rehearsal kiss, that's consent. The second is his apology where he said his account of what happened is a little different from what she said. The picture you can obviously see the shadows of his hands hovering over here not really touching her and she was wearing a heavy military vest so even if he had it's not even direct contact like through a shirt. You are the misinformed idiot, everything you said is wrong, and the only thing your right about is this isn't a debate because the facts are indisputable.

Tweeden has been on Hannity's show.  This effectively killed the Roy Moore story for the day when Hannity was taking a tremendous amount of heat.  That's part of this story.  It may bear out that Al Franken has a history of sexual harassment.  There may be a chorus of accusers waiting in the wings here, but what we've seen here is an allegation about kissing in a skit and a stupid unfortunate posed picture that was probably funny at the time.  This was against the background of a USO tour where Tweeden role was one of the Playboy bunny exiting the helicopter in Apocalypse Now.  She wasn't ""sexualized"" by Franken as Michael Shore says.

She probably would have found a way to pay back Franken with her own staged photo shoot. With regards to the kiss, I strongly doubt any comedy writer/performer would view it as anything other than trying to see if it worked comedically. Actors in the comedy/improv world separate themselves from their craft and often go with outrageous stunts in order to get the laugh. It�۪s not a sexual thing for them even if contact is made. It�۪s satire. The problem occurs when one someone from a different culture embarks on the group and/or does not clearly communicate their boundaries beforehand. They may not even realize they need to communicate those boundaries, so it truly is a case of clashing cultures as opposed to sexual assault. I have worked in improv & theater in my younger years. When it came to scenes where kissing or even dramatic statements of love were required, I did not have the ability to separate my personal feelings from the character. Knowing this, I veered away from those roles and eventually stopped altogether. Others I know had no problem with it and progressed professionally or semi-professionally. All to say, I think she was coming from a completely different culture and mindset. So, of course, it resulted in something awful for her.But this is a far cry from Franken whipping out his willy, backing her into a corner, blocking access to leave, actually groping her, or propositioning a 14 year old.

The Democratic party is not important. Al Franken's career, or possible run for President is not important. What is important is showing a consistent message and set of principles in all situations. Even if this is a Republican hatchet job, Franken should step down immediately, all liberals should express their outrage at what he did, while offering forgiveness, and everyone should just leave it at that.

I get what you are saying, and there may well be some truth to it, but it is not entirely false equivalency. She may well be a con artist, hack, or anything else you want to call her, and may well be playing politics, but the fact is that Franken has admitted it, even if not exactly as she portrays it. The other thing to remember is that both sides play politics, both sides hire hatchet men, both sides pay people to come forward with accusations. In essence, in a game where both sides are playing dirty, and both sides are using the game of politics against the other, the only way to actually win, and by win I mean show that you are actually the principled side, is a) to actually act according to principles, and b) not to fight back against these accusations, but let the justice system, investigations, etc, run their course. The end goal is get legislation passed that benefits the people of the country, and, if you are left leaning, the best chance of that right now is, unfortunately, the Democratic party, which means it has to keep its hands clean and always act in a way that will ensure that it stands up for principles, ie very differently from the way it has acted in the past. That means letting Franken go if necessary. It also means letting the democratic party go if necessary. The ultimate goal is to pass the best legislation, and have the best possible government, not to 'be in power' or have Al Franken as president, or have the Democrats win the next election.

Maybe not. One thing is clear, and that is that while this woman may have reluctantly agreed to do a 'stage kiss' she didn't agree to a tongue in the mouth, which does not provide full consent. To be slightly pedantic here, Roy Moore is accused of sexual contact with an underage girl, a teenager, not a child. It is underage all the same, but a teenager is not the same as a child, and I think all the cries of pedophile are debasing the word, which is meant to apply to pre-pubescents, not teenagers, and doesn't refer to abuse in any case. This does not lessen it in any way, and the main thing is that this 14 year old girl did NOT consent to any of it (yes she can't consent legally, but it is important to note that she also DIDN'T in any way, which worsen it even more in my mind), and clearly did not want to be anywhere near him.In any case, by the rules of YouTube, I am pretty sure this is the point where one of us gets angry and starts calling the other cuck, or libtard, or some such thing.

By the way, saying that happens in most medias is no excuse for it of course. What you are doing with your remarks saying  ""they aren't trying to sell books about their encounters"" or that said people are ""washed up"" is just demeaning, distasteful and outright wrong attempt to minimalize allegations backed with credible evidence. Its the same shtick that the left did for Juanita Broaddrick in defense of Bill Clinton, and that some people on the right are now doing for Roy Moore saying it was consensual so forth.  If you read sources ranging from all political aisles not just these that support your existing views then well done. When you say that TYT is the number one online political show that is a little troubling though, and shows perhaps a lapse of judgement. Regardless, I'm not sure about you but I will be happy to see the last of both Roy Moore and Al Franken out of the senate and politics altogether.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.75

Watch it over the past 40+ years and you will see that it is a regular occurrence that both male & female actors take in stride. It is as much a part of physical comedy as falling down.There is a line between abuse, exerting power/force over a person, predatory behavior and displaying one�۪s privilege/dominance over another person. I don�۪t view these acts as crossing that line in THIS CONTEXT.
