This time the stakes were higher than they ever were because we were at an apex on this planet we had never reached. every 100 years or so this type of people uprising has happened. and though at different times different countries or peoples were able to break the yoke off of their neck, we as a world were never able to undo the elite that ruled the world. now they  have come together and are stronger than ever. and this 100 year cycle we did not succeed. and there was more to win than ever. and more to lose than ever. this loss against the elite, royal, super wealthy, will cost us most of the species of actual animal life on the planet earth. alot of the big game will be gone forever. such as countless ocean species. polar bear, almost all of the tropical jungle species in many nations, elephants, tigers will all become extinct. alot of land mass will be taken by ocean. the medicical discoveries like cures for cancer, all diseases, etc will be pushed back 50  years and in about 100 years we will have the chance to rise up and free the world again. i hope we succeed in creating a new earth at that time. in that 100 years about 1 billion lives will be cut short that could have been saved had we succeeded now. think of that. we just lost most of the species on the planet. the oceans grew to to cause mass exodus and overcrowding where we could live. we sacrificed over 1 billion human lives. the stakes will be even greater 100 years from now .",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Positive/,Positive,0.689

Humans need to solve their own problems first if they do that actually would help all these endangered animals a lot more then just by approaching the problem directly... That actually would save the planet unlike no head hunting policy with a constant barrage of moralizing highly reminiscent of all the moral preaching done by pro-lifers (some lives are less sentient then others and choices can maim life) or even pro-abortion (fetus have the ability to be a life). I think people should just shut up when it comes to moralizing it doesn't work since life is pretty much amoral.

""reversing the horrible treatment of these animals IS the VERY DEFINITION of reforming the species""
Faulty logic you think lion's treat their victim's nicely and would they ever care 

""what doers an elephant have that cows don't?""

I was talking about the environment where those elephants actually lived not people far far away... 

 ""you do know what an ENDANGERED species is right?.""
That actually depends on how endangered (critically???) and if highly controlled trophy hunting makes the conservation sustainable not be totally dependent on charity... That helps no one and thanks to a incredibly STUPID PETA they actually have destroyed so many communities (e.g that seal clubbing ban because of its assumption of ""inhuman practices"" destroyed entire remote communities)
  
""strawman excuse there are MANY MANY people who do more than just tweet'
Not even in the same universe as going on a general strike... Tell me when that day comes when people actually go on a general strike on behalf of other communities that's how I know people have at least reform this generation or the last.   

""are you seriously gullible enough to think that anyone only fights for this cause and no other?""
You are missing the point if people cannot solve their own problems first then their would be totally utterly useless to fight other species related problems because our problems would kill them first.

I've always thought that it undermines the integrity of what hunters do. That's why I don't bat an eye at an African tribe brutally killing an elephant or hippo by spearing it over and over again because I know they'll use it to sustain themselves, whereas I don't much care for trophy hunters, unless they're spear hunting or doing something that gives the animal equal chance. Blowing away an elephant with a .700 nitro express from 100 yards away is hardly a ""hunt"".

All this said, I'm failing to see where they're making the relationship between government sponsored and approved trophy hunting and the black market ivory trade, which is where your poachers come in. The elephant is GOING to be hunted by these trophy hunters, whether or not you and I like it. With that fact being as it may, I don't see the problem with making these hunters jump through hoops and pay boatloads of money to bring back their trophy when the money goes toward conservation. For those not in the know, businesses such as Ducks Unlimited have contributed more money that PETA towards wildlife conservation. Several times over, in fact. To conflate poaching with documented trophy hunting for conservation's benefit is extremely disingenuous, but I'm not too surprised considered that TYT spins and lampoons anything connected to Donald Trump.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.857

""It is a century now since Darwin gave us the first glimpse of the origin of species. We know now what was unknown to all the preceding caravan of ­generations: that man is only a fellow-voyager with other creatures in the Odyssey of evolution, and that his captaincy of the adventuring ship conveys the power, but not necessarily the right, to discard at will among the crew. We should, in the century since Darwin, have achieved a sense of community with living things, and of wonder over the magnitude and duration of the ­biotic enterprise.

For one species to mourn the death of another is a new thing under the sun. The Cro-Magnon who slew the last mammoth thought only of steaks. The sportsman who shot the last pigeon thought only of his prowess. The sailor who clubbed the last auk thought of nothing at all. But we, who have lost our pigeons, mourn the loss. Had the funeral been ours, the pigeons would hardly have mourned us. In this fact, rather than in Mr. Vandevar Bush’s bombs, or Mr. DuPont’s nylons, lies objective evidence of our superiority over the beasts.""

Though, put simply, it is up to those countries to protect those endangered species. There isn't much we can do other than try to show leadership and set an example. And honestly I think the United States has set a fantastic example on how to treat wildlife over the past 100 years or so. (Not when it comes to factory farming, but when it comes to stuff like the Game and Fish boards. If you don't believe me, pick a crime; commit it in front an officer and see what happens. Then, do the same crime in a national forest in front of a wildlife officer and see what happens. :D You'll get a ticket for littering in the city, and you'll get your house searched for littering in the Forest.) The money people pay to hunt these animals does great things for these animals, and not only that, killing almost every animal - if not EVERY SINGLE animal - these conservationists allow to be killed is necessary anyways. After the story about the Lion the dentist killed, a lot of conservation money was lost and a ton of problem lions were put down anyways. I think when someone hunts these animals, the majority of everything should go to the locals. But I don't see a problem with allowing whatever kind of trophy the conservation society there deems fit for a person to keep, allowing that person to keep and bring back. Hell, they could even charge extra money for something like that. 

Also, I want to be clear that I don't believe in hunting for sport at all. I know that a lot of the people that go do this... that's WHY they are there. But, if somebody is going to have to go out and kill a problem animal anyways, why not take a bunch of money from an asshat that has never hunted without paying for it to do it?

The last thing I'll say in support of hunting is this, if you eat meat - but you're against hunting; you're just as big of an asshole as you view trophy hunters. I don't have a problem with farming... I have a problem with factory farming. Unfortunately, that's where most of the meat you buy nowadays comes from. If you can't bring yourself to either hunt, shoot, and then at least gut the animal, or to slaughter an animal; maybe you shouldn't eat meat. When I kill a deer I gut it myself, but I bring it to a professional afterwards to butcher it, so as little meat is wasted as possible. I'll still eat meat bought from the grocery store, and sometimes I still go to taco bell; but after I killed and gutted my first deer, it happens a lot less often. I feel much better about eating it if I did it myself.

Once again, it's no surprise that this is something happening under the Trump administration.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.805

If someone really wanted to make a difference couldn't they pay the 200K just as a donation or for a trip to look at the elephants? The only reason they kill them is because they take some pleasure in killing an animal. Sure that in a roundabout way does give money to conservation efforts but you cant pretend these people shoot elephants because they care so deeply about the cause. They just shoot elephants for fun, and paying into conservation is just a legal way to justify it. By the way i have nothing against hunting for food and putting all the other parts to use so as not to waste, but i can not understand the need or desire to kill something for the pure enjoyment of watching it die and keeping part of its corpse around. If all they care about is saving the elephants that's fine they can still send the money. There is just no reason to kill it also. Why not pay 200k for a safari or to feed an elephant?

The reality is that the commercial hunting lobby has a strong voice and have become quite adapt in presenting themselves as the saviors of african wildlife. When you dive in to this subject you will soon find out their is a much darker world behind these hunting organisations. Only last year a well known wildlife preservationist was killed on the street in Tanzania. This is a world of large amounts of money, egotistical men who don't understand the word no and 3rd grade corrupt regimes profiteering from this business.

You only advocate for lower regulation when and if they serve your purpose.  

 For example, in the case of this and other gun related stuff Republicans typically scream, ""Too much government regulation on guns, those dang Democrats trying to take my guns away.""   However when it comes for a woman's right to choose you have no problem setting up tons of regulation to tell others how they can live their life completely ignoring the 14th amendment.

Also then there is Net Neutrality which actually protects the free market on the internet which conservatives seem to be against even though they consistently claim they are for a free market.

Sure, big game hunts cost $ but only a small percentage of the money trophy hunters pay is allocated toward conservation or local communities (approx 3%). Trophy hunting is also harmful to animal populations....killing a male lion leaves his fellow pride leaders open to challenges from other males. If a new male does come in, they could kill an entire generation of cubs, which means that the permit for one lion hunt leads to the death of several animals.   Finally, the biggest rebuttal to the hunting-helps-populations argument is in the numbers. Lions have lost 95 percent of their population since the 1940s. The African elephant population has dropped from several million at the turn of the century to roughly 500,000 today.

You don't even care about your own species... In last massively massive mass shooting where hundreds of people die and people decided their protest was just a ""Tweet"" that's just pathetic why not go on a general strike by grouping together even if it means you might actually lose your jobs.

If you cannot care or even reform your own species in any small way or large as possible you don't deserve to care about any other species... You be surprised by the results you will get...
