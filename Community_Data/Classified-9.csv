Deep state as in military-industrial complex? What did you think of Trump's military goods deal with Saudi Arabia? Don't you find it odd to align in such fashion with the country that contains the Wahhabi extremist? Unless you were looking to spread terrorism globally?
Why then would you do that if they were uncontrolled and not state actors, then again maybe there hierarchy is controlled and thus taking marching orders? You could then move them around the globe and thus just instantly provide motive, where ever one wished to invade and loot? I ponder could any of these things be possible?
You know what domestically wouldn't help a country with a horrific wealth gap between the wealthiest and the poorest? In such a country would you make a tax plan, that penalized all earning below seventy-five thousand to benefit mostly those making millions? When most all the country falls well below forty thousand a year, it seems almost criminal doesn't it?
Apparently, deficit spending and worries over national debts weren't bad enough to block those in power from reaching in and taking as they well, please. Then again when was that ever the case, yes now whenever we wanted to spend it on social programs for the common people then it is socialist, apparently not if benefits billionaires like Trump. Whom I recall bragging immodestly about being so smart he pays no taxes, that is a fellow that should decide tax policy.
Dividing the nation further along class lines of wealth seems to be of no concern to some, yet looking around I cannot fathom why but then I'm one of the unwashed masses.  
Fortunately, in some eyes, at least none of that will get spent on say children or elderly people getting affordable medical care or food, that would be nasty socialism....

"" I do agree with your thoughts on Saudi Arabia but, how much do you blame on one man, even the President? ""

Well, true he is one man with a clear favoritism for the wealthy the corporate and powerful elite, his agenda is largely if not exclusively tinted to those of that interest group. They would seem to have a set of consistent interests of which is exploitation of the earth and all its inhabitants, they seek only for power and wealth and control of all of it. Have no love nor care of any persons outside their own an absolutely no limits nor moral foundations whatsoever. He is of a divisive character that blames poorer persons for issues created by very wealthy persons like himself. If you are blaming the powerless for issues affecting you, you most likely are deceived by someone with more power than you. 
He currently is the now representative of that group I described above, so as was Obama and Bill and George before him. I know they all seek to distract play nationalities race and religion, all for their own personal benefit.... Notice how none of our American problems derive from class or wealth distribution, the Americans get poorer and poorer. Yet all our enemies are south of the border or the poor of the middle east of Africa, whom not ironically can't afford a pot to piss in and if they had one our prior generations elite would have looted that also long ago.
What do the elite not like Roosevelt like policies, in modern terms like health care for all and free college and a 15$ an hour living wage. They are opposed to regulations like in banking, cause that is how collapse economies and buy up everything... Which is why they love deregulation, cause rules are for poor persons and minorities not persons of means, Trump hates regulations right and how non-surprising of him?
They love military spending and empire building as it were big old military bases everywhere all the time, they have to steal something, right cause we are not a charity last I looked? He the populist is right there boosting military spending, another non-surprising shocker, being he totally faked being a populist as in giving a damned about us.
With all this and much much more I could delve into, why would I ever at all support him being of sound mind? It would offend everything I hold dear or true to do so and be counter to my own well being!

One of the first things he did was to pull out of the TPP, and NAFTA. He then attacked obuma care, which yes did provide access to health care BUT at such a cost that people could not afford to use it. Obuma card's premiums were set to skyrocket making obuma care set to implode. His proposed tax bill has very much in favor of the poor and middle class. Health care and the proposed tax plan were met with heavy opposition by the Globaists from BOTH parties, just as his immigration plan was.

These Globalists with the tools they have such as the ""FAKE Media"" Hollywood, and groups such as BLM and ANTIFA have been relentless in there efforts to portray Trump in the light that you have expressed.

He said that another member of law enforcement was considering charges and that he just wanted to speak with him. He's a public servant and people have complained. Following up on this is part of his job. Don't get me wrong, absolutely keep the amazing graphics on the truck. But come on, this title is all types of misleading as is the representation of the meaning of is tweet. The other story that got under my skin was the misrepresentation of the C-Star ship story. TYT did a segment in which they claimed that the C-Star was assisted by the Sea-Eye. This is incorrect. The Sea-Eye was prepared to assist but in the end it wasn't necessary. Altering these small stories to advance a narrative takes away from your coverage of larger issues. The fact that the Sea-Eye was prepared to assist is just as powerful as it actually doing so. It raises the question of whether or not to trust your reporting in other instances. If you're going to report on these stories, please ensure it's accurate to maintain the standard of reporting that your audience expects. I'll continue to be a fan of TYT, but these instances are disappointing and muddy the waters of all of your reporting integrity.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.768

We have had 6 differing party systems in the history of this country starting with the anti-federalist(States rights, decentralized government(Ex a confederacy), Little or no form of Regulation from the government, and Low to little taxes)  vs the Federalists(Centralized government, Powers of Regulation, Higher Taxes, ) This was the fight over the articles of the Confederacy which ended in absolute failure and when the Federalists tried to create the Union the Anti-Federalist rebelled in the Whisky Rebellion. They were routed and for a while, all we had were the Federalist then the remanents created the Democratic-Republicans. I'm not sure if I need to go on

Its is not ironic that today's Republican platform is a complete mirror of the Democractic platform of the 1800s which was practically a mirror of the Anti-Federalists. They're the same people today as they were back then all they've done is changed names not their positions or political stances. But sure lets suppose the parties didn't switch so 
If the parties Never Switched I ask this to Republicans 
1) How do you explain the changing dynamics of ethic groups from asians blacks whites mexicans and so On as well as religious groups and economic groups from particular career choices (example scientist that normally vote liberal go from republican to democratic over the years) all these demographics are showing a changing trend of the people who once voted for democrats slowly changing their vote to Republicans and vise versa due to one party becoming Conservative and the other Liberal over time 
2) How do you explain that geographically the traditional Conservative Southern states that All once Voted Democrat during the civil war era Now Vote Republican as well as other political geographic locations Such as the North East that Vote Republican during the Civil war now Vote Democrat and many more showing the same trend 
3) Why is it that these demographics never deviate significantly from the same political issues but vote consistently generation after generation on these issues would go from democrat to republican or republican to democrat if the parties did not exchange/switch their political platforms 
4)How is it that the Republican Political Platforms of Today Mirrors that of the Democratic platform of the Civil War Era 
5) Why is that Republicans Tax plans follow similar tax plans that Democrats used during the Civil war 
6)Why do Republicans Jerry-mander in efforts to restrict voting rights of African Americans and Civil Rights Workers 
7) How do you account that all hate groups working against civil rights for blacks women minorities and LGQTB Identify as Conservative and Identify as White Supremacist Mainly Vote Republican 
8) Why are there Laws that disproportionately incarcerate blacks indicative of systemic racism that had always been passed in historical Southern and Conservative States on the democratic ticket of yester year now being passed in those Same states Under the Republican Ticket? 
9) Why do families with long standing histories of abolitionists and educators have ancestors that were in the republican party but now whose descendants who hold the same views and still continue to fight for civil rights and higher education, which is what the slave driving conservative confederates were against, are now democrats with grandparents or even worse great grandparents who can tell them why they their friends other families and political leaders and people with political oppositions toward them switched parties?
10) Why was The Civil Rights Act of 1964  written by a democratic congressman, passed by a democratic house and senate, and signed into law by a Democratic president and passed with democrats 65% Senate 59% House and against Republican 35% Sentate 41%House",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.742

The right simply doubles down because they can never admit they were wrong. 

Take what's going on with Al Franken and Roy Moore. When the allegations against Moore came out, everyone backing him denied it and called the reports of his pedophilia, some from his own colleagues, political sensationalism. They simply denied and double down.

On the other hand when the allegations came out about Al Franken, one of the heavy weights of Liberalism and progressivism on the left, he was flatly condemned by the left. After having been called out he issued an apology and didn't deny a single one of the allegations against him. And that right there is the difference between right and left. The right will never own up to their own mistakes and never admit they were wrong while the left will and regularly does.

Which leads to my final point about ANTIFA and the alt-right. While ANTIFAs message is one of suppressing hatred, the left will still renounce anyone in that group for violent acts they've committed. The alt-right having a message of white nationalism and hatred regularly commits far more atrocious acts like the murder of Heather Heyer, the firing of firearms into crowds of protestors, and acts of extreme hate and violence, yet the right will still make excuses for them.

In the end violence from either side is unacceptable, but let's not act like the messages of both sides are morally equal and that one side hasn't outright murdered a person for simply exercising her first amendment right.",9,/Negative/,Negative,0.734

This is what Sigmund Freud referred to as ""Personality Projection"" -the ability to see your own faults in others. Simply looking at the facts will tell you this is not true. Look at the facts:

1. One only needs to look at the 8 years when Obama was President to see where the racism comes from. There were calls for Obama to be lynched from Day 1 on the right, even before he took office.

2. Or the fact that racial minorities participation remains almost non-existent in the GOP.

3. Or that the Jim Crow South is predominately in Republican states

4. Or the fact which party overwhelming discriminates against minorities or uses voter suppression tactics to keep minorities off the ballot

5. Or the fact that all the racist groups like the Neo-Nazis or the KKK are overwhelming on the right

Robert Bryd joined the KKK as a anti-communist when he was 18 and left in the 1950s and since repeatedly apologized for his membership. He spent the next 5 decades helping minorities to atone and was Honored by the NAACP because of it. That sound like a born and bred racist to you?

LBJ was a racist yes, but he kept his personal views about blacks to himself and passed the civil rights act after Kennedys death. He might have been personal racist but he did not pursue a racist politic.

Not directed at you, just an observation in general. This country is filled with cry-babies that overreact to everything.

The fact that this is even an issue at all demonstrates that there is a faction within our society - not necessarily politically aligned either as the Left has this problem in spades if not more - that absolutely cannot tolerate anything that offends their precious sensibility. What should be entirely their own problem to deal with, they make the world's problem and expect everyone else to bend over heel for them.

To put it bluntly; the United States as a nation is overly sensitive and is becoming progressively more so with each passing year. This is something that should be spoken out against, because it already manifests in violations of civil and constitutional liberties and demands for further restrictions that are already bordering on being unconstitutional.
