UgxioNG7ZHOElFPF8TN4AaABAg,John Snow,3 weeks ago,1511775436889,"There's a lot to digest here and nuance is especially important in a situation like this. There are a lot of possibilities and we need to be careful how we talk about them.

1.) There is a difference between an American or even British / US allied news outlet leaking information. Their motives are significantly less likely to be on the State / national security / Global scale. The BBC leaking the same exact stuff as Wikileaks IS different because of this. The incentives are fundamentally different for why they leak - which I think is clear by the fact that Wikileaks was at the very least biased here. There is no reason to think that the BBC would be biased and say, not leak damning things about Trump (like Wikileaks refused to do).

2.) Wikileaks knows that they have an image of impartiality to uphold, and who knows how long this has been going on for. Maybe the US security agencies were right and seen through this ploy to be impartial (perhaps because they got hold of these kinds of communications before), and knew all along that Wikileaks was a tool for the Russians. I think we need to re-asses what our intelligence agencies have said about Wikileaks after this revelation. It's quite possible they have been fooling us all along.

3.) The Trump campaign knew that Wikileaks was officially regarded as an agent of Russia, and this is important. If (as it seems), the Trump campaign knowingly coordinated and worked with Wikileaks, with the official ""Russian Agent"" designation that the US has given Wikileaks, then that is by definition collusion.  Now, we might've said in the past that this is a weak argument because the US intelligence agencies couldn't be trusted to be telling the truth here. However, as I said in #2, we need to seriously re-asses this. I think Mueller will look at the evidence that our intelligence agencies have on Wikileaks, and if it is true that they're a Russian agent, then he will suggest that Trump colluded. 

So just to summarized, we have definitive evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia IF Wikileaks is an agent of Russia. We just need to wait and see how the cards fall. 

Also, I should note that we don't need Wikileaks to learn about the DNC corruption. The people that got a-hold of that evidence could've given it to Fox News just as easily as Wikileaks. Wikileaks does seem to have a pattern of trying to support Trump AND cause political turmoil both in the Right and Left (Trump was a controversial, divisive figure in the Primary if you recall).",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.838

From day one, they've been a thorn in the side of the establishment. Ever since, the establishment has marked them as a target. They've spent years now repeating over and over in the media that Wikileaks was a bad actor, with many allegations, many of them turning out to have no basis in reality. But it is all part of a common strategy, much as they're doing with Trump and Russia. 1. Make public allegation and repeat it over and over even if you don't have evidence, 2. Take all avenues that could lead to something damning related to the allegation, 3. By the time something even a little bit juicy comes up, it is magnified 1000 fold by the hysteria that preceded it, and creates a feeling of vindication for those who sided with the establishment to begin with. It is depressingly successful with people in general. But my brain works a bit differently, the more you insist on something without evidence, the less impressed I am when you do find anything. Call it my BS defense mechanism. If more people took my approach, maybe people in news and politics would have one less recourse to get public opinion to match whatever manufactured pseudo-truth they wish to push forward.
To me, Wikileaks' motives have always been clear, and it is obvious in their actions: they hate corruption, and they want everything to be transparent. Similarly, the establishment's motives are obvious: maintain the status quo, continue to give even more power to corporations. By definition, Wikileaks gets its agenda forward by publishing anything they can get their hands on.

The established Democrats and established Republicans along with the Federal Reserve banking cartel will be watching my post as they have in the past. And will make sure I ruin their agenda as they have ruined mine.

It is only obvious that every sentient being alive today has a bias or motive. That said, is it any wonder why Julian Assange might take Trump's side when his life depends on it; not implying that Hillary's minions are not capable of putting a hit on opposition or that Trump has nothing to gain from Julian's willing hand in exposing the Hillary crime syndicate. 

        Yet, what should be relevant here is the fact that the Clintons like the Trump crime family are as much as guilty of treason and crimes against humanity per the Rights of Conquest, Pact of Paris, Article I, Blue Water Laws (Black Water Thesis), SEC rules, Code Federal Regulations, Contract Laws, and many other laws pertinent to the manipulation, bribery, acceptance of gifts, control of institutions meant to regulate and the influencing of the judiciary through political motives to promote the view that there is an oligarchy made up of corporate and the film industry when the""plutocracy"" comes from the Federal Reserve banking cartel who have interests in corporate, political, and in the film industries. 

   This Russian narrative needs to stop. As a Computer Engineer and a Legal Researcher I can tell you with 100% of certainty that the leak was a reverse engineering job as the transfer rates as pointed out by Forensicator is sound and conclusively logical without reasonable doubt and is not declaratory or a conclusion of law; since, forensic analysis has proven that during the half of 2016; transfer speeds where not remotely possible at that time. 

Whether others might have come close to attaining that transfer rate is not in question here.

 The question about timestamps is also moot; since, any hacker doing social engineering from any country or locally could have altered the timestamp and to take it further altered the MAC address. This gets ruled out. It is irrelevant to ask this question as seasoned hackers know that would be a first thought of process.

Yet, the only give away is the transfer rate in which the Podesta files where transferred is the nail-in-the coffin. Why the media and other alternative did not give too much on this subject matter is indicative that the Russian narrative is the scapegoat for the Clintons to evade the question or muddy the waters to vindicate Hillary as a victim of espionage and redirect attention to Don the con. 

The question should not be who or what was the ulterior motive behind Julian but the context surrounding the hack. Cenk, you should know that legally the Legislature and the courts follow substance not form. The substance pertains to how a rigged system can encroach any party lines, Government (local, state, Federal), the media, corporate lobbyist, pharmaceutical, and film industry (sorry if I left any other Federal Reserve bank dependent).",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.734

also just a side note at least the founder isnt american and a lot of it people arent, the people involved at wikileaks with trump might not be either they have no reason to be loyal and work in america best interests. that might be cruel but no citizen of any country really has a reason to work in the interest of another country.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.814

UgyMUOXeT54Yw3IR8yJ4AaABAg,bjm090,1 month ago,1510997847142,"Cenk is absolutely wrong. He isn't willing to call a spade a spade. Wikileaks serves an important function in the contemporary world, but it is clear that Wikileaks deserves harsh judgment. First, they were encouraging Trump to challenge the election process as rigged (ex. that the votes of million of illegal voters swung the election); Wikileaks knows that illegal voting had no effect on the outcome of the presidential election. Second, Wikileaks released material at politically opportune times and not as is normally the case, when the story was ready to hit the presses. Third, this material was originally obtained by Russian hackers looking to sway the American election. Fourth, Wikileaks is not supposed to be a political organization. It is an organization supposedly dedicated to releasing information that is important for citizens of the world to hear; it has not other political affiliations outside of that political function. 

Not only is the despicable behaviour, but it bears little similarities between the Ellsburgs/Snowdens of the world. The DNC's emails are no Pentagon papers; Daniel Ellsberg told the American public the truth of the American involvement of Vietnam, which the past administrations had been lying about. He only did this after being torn between feelings of duty to his superiors and duty to his country. Young, male Russian hackers posting disturbing, out-right false material online and then stealing private material in hopes of obtaining damning information to vilify their political opponents (i.e. the USA) bears little comparison besides the fact that both Russian Hackers/Daniel Ellsburg, Wikileaks/the NYT stole and published private/top secret material. But, as I hope this comparison shows, the differences between the two cases are just as relevant as their similarities.

Could you imagine if we discovered that the NYT was secretly speaking with the Clinton campaign and encouraging Clinton to challenge the election results as an act of democratic sabotage? Imagine that they wanted to work together to delegitimize the results of a well-conducted, fair election through the use of complete falsehoods. That the NYT was publishing material obtained from Mexican hackers seeking to undermine US democracy for their own national interests. People would be calling for the closing of the NYT and rightfully so. Anna is right that this all paints a terrible picture of Wikileaks. I still don't quite understand why they wanted the Trump campaign to win. But this whole thing makes me suspect that the environment at Wikileaks has gone rotten. Cenk!

Imagine some scenarios for rigging. Say you find out that a casino manipulated a card game to make it favor the house much more than advertised under the normal understanding of the game. Is that a rigged game, or not? The players could possibly still win sometimes, but they're going to be much more likely to lose than they should. Lots of people would call this a rigged game even if the outcome of any particular game is not fixed.

Or take a boxing match where one team paid the referee to be favorable to their fighter and unfavorable to the other fighter. Is that a rigged fight? They're cheating, but the other fighter could still possibly win anyway. The ref cheating on their behalf can't necessarily guarantee the desired outcome, like if their fighter just gets knocked out right away. But lots of people would call that a rigged fight, because they're cheating the advertised process.

Wikileaks is obviously going to pretend they're on the side of any powerful person they are messaging. Notice how they asked Truno Jr to leak his dads tax returns. They were hoping to get info out of him. They threw in that bot about appearing impartial as a way to convince Jr that they were on his side. Important thing to note. Nothing wikileaks or Assange has ever released or claimed has EVER been false. That's a pretty impressive record. So when they say their sources aren't Russian they would be risking their perfect track record if they were lying. If anything Assange implied Seth Rich was his source.

I was quite honestly shocked by that message as I thought they always had leftist sympathies (given their appearance at Green party events).

Julian pissed off the CIA by dumping all the information he received on there in apt IT section allowing the world to know that the CIA isn’t capable of monitoring or protecting us from Internet viruses that could shut our entire Country down. But he did offer to help them fix it and Patchett. That being said it is not hard to believe that the CIA would set him up to look as though he was a bad actor. No one has shown any proof that Russia was involved in hacking our systems. The only mention of hacking came from HRC‘s camp during the primaries and even then she did not allow the FBI or D HS to look at her computers or servers for signs and evidence of hacking. This hacking only came on the radar because of HRC. We all now know with Donna Brazil‘s book exactly what she is capable of and will continue to be capable of. She’s not in the woods somewhere she owes billions of dollars to special interest groups that were expecting her to win the election and Garner the favors the pay to play so she will ensure that we have another establishment candidate that will for fill those promises made. Now back onto the topic I do believe the CIA have set him up in order to bolster the hacking Russia scenario sticking him to the Russia scenario so they can along with England bring him to America where he will Pay dearly for being 100% correct and having a clean record.

There are plenty of corruption cases when it comes to Sanders. He colluded with his wife to try to get Vermont's nuclear waste dumped on a small hispanic community in Texas.
Also colluded with his wife to run a college into the ground and collect a $200,000 severence package. He's currently under investigation for bank fraud on that one.
Also, his senior campaign advisor has confessed that Donna Brazille has emailed their campaign questions from the CNN debate, just like she did Hillary, just like she's done to every ither Democrat in her tenure. Why was only Hillary targeted? Because wikileaks is biased maybe?
And lets not forget Bernies tax returns. The latests ones he's submitted showed him taking full advantage of the mortage interest deduction- a tax loophole he onced deemed ""welfare for millionaires"". He was paying taxes equivalent to a household making HALF his wage at the time. I'm kinda interested in how his taxes have changed after buying that 3rd house. Where is wikileaks on that one?

Poimt being: You shouldn't have to wait for a biased medium to tell you something that you don't even want to believe in the first place. That's sort of like being a slave to propaganda.

It is correct that Bernie now owns three homes: a home in Vermont, a townhouse in DC and now a vacation home that they bought with some inheritance Jane received.

I could only find that in 1997 Bernie proposed capping the mortgage interest deduction at $300,000.  Home prices very substantially went up since then (I bought my first home in 1997 in California for $169,000, and it is worth over $500,000 now) , so if it was adjusted since then to account for real estate inflation since then, his personal mortgage interest deductions would probably still fit with his thinking at that time.

I couldn't find any news stories about Bernie colluding with his wife on the college issue.

Even the ones you mentioned. That's why scientists and doctors try to be 100% transparent, because they also question everything (that's exactly why they're scientists). They share all their research, make their recommendations, and allow us to come to our own conclusions. We then look at who funded their research and how the doctor/scientist would/could benefit from it. Then we determine if we really do benefit from it, and if the benefits outweigh the risk. 

Would I question my doctor? Of course. That's why we have meet and greets first. If they prescribe medication or point towards an illness, do we not research the medication/illness ourselves? Do we not get second opinions?

Take some psychology, sociology, and government courses. Knowing that humans are flawed isn't the solution. You have to know their trends, motivations, how they rationalise their own actions and the actions of others, and how far they're willing to go. How much farther they're willing to push their moral goalpost in order to get what they believe needs to be done. Know the type of people that are attracted to certain careers. Know what type of people excel in those careers. How do governments and corporations thrive. How big of a motivator is money? What compromises people are willing to make for power and recognition? The likelihood that as a company or organisation increases in size and donors that the company/organisation will have the same goals and level of integrity. Do people give purely out of the goodness of their heart?

Do your own research and don't blindly trust anyone. It really isn't that hard and you'll live a great life. Accept that everyone is flawed and have hidden motivations and you'll never be disappointed by people, just pleasantly surprised and often vindicated. You'll love more deeply too. ""Question everything"" and “Hope for the best, prepare for the worst” are my mottos.

But neither your comment nor the original comment even mentioned the right. This is becoming a chronic problem in politics: millions of people on the right do something bad, no one says a word. One person on the left does something bad, everyone attacks the left. Go back and read +do ht’s comment. Anyone who reads his comment - and takes it seriously - would think that the left is more prone to conspiracy theories than the right. Nowhere in his comment does he say that the Right is FAR MORE LIKELY to make excuses for Putin than the left is (even “far more likely” is a massive understatement). To attack the Left without stating unequivocally that the Left is more reasonable than the Right is to commit a kind of implicit false equivalence. In fact, it’s even worse than false equivalence because +do ht’s comment actually implies that the left is WORSE than the right. 

The left is never as bad as the right. Ever. We have to be careful with false equivalencies. There’s nothing that anyone on the left believes that is as dangerous as what Steve Bannon believes. To suggest otherwise is to underestimate the danger that the alt right poses to liberal democracy.

As for Kyle, I dispute your characterization. In fact, I don’t even know what you’re talking about. Sees them as infallible? When has he ever said that? As far as I know, he’s never said anything like that. Does he applaud some of the contributions Wikileaks has made to our public discourse? Sure. So would I. Wikileaks deserves some credit for leaking the classified, explosive video of an American helicopter attack in Baghdad that left 12 people dead, including two employees of the Reuters news agency. Every American citizen should see that video. But does that excuse Wikileaks’ behavior in the 2016 election? Of course it doesn’t. And I doubt Kyle excuses it either.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.926

You’re living in the wrong decade. Virtually no one on the left talks about anti-imperialism nowadays. I haven’t even heard the term in years. ""Anti-imperialism” became a leftwing craze in the 60s and 70s with the advent of postcolonial theory, and then it came back into vogue in the 90s with the popularity of postmodernism and the second generation of postcolonial theorists like Homi Bhabha. And you’’re right; that was absurd. But it hasn’t been a problem since I was a kid in the 90s. I honestly don’t know what you’re talking about; I can’t think of any leftwing commentator (apart from Jimmy Dore) who still uses the term “anti-imperialism.” You’re chasing a ghost. The problem you’re complaining about doesn’t exist.

As for your other comment, you should be careful.

To give a real example, Foreign Policy has reported that Wikileaks declined to publish leaks from the Russian Interior Ministry because Wikileaks did not have resources to deal with anything else during the election cycle, on which they were singularly focused. Given Assange's professed desire to undermine American hegemony and the grudge he bears Hillary Clinton/ Obama, it's not surprising that he chose the Podesta/DNC emails as the priority, but it is disappointing.


 It's also a little disappointing to have it more or less confirmed now that they timed their releases for maximum effect—a technique often used by governments to disseminate propaganda—and perhaps also to cover for Trump. They weren't simply releasing information as they were able to, or when it was ready. They acted in a calculated way to influence people's perception of the candidates—which on a certain level is fine, if the information is accurate, but I think they strayed beyond that into a gray area of manipulation. 

If that is the case, and they had information ready and available during the primary, that means that they chose not to potentially aid a stable candidate like Sanders but instead to throw some measure of support toward Trump in the general. Lots of people suspected that Wikileaks was holding out, and now it seems like that might have been true. It certainly fits Assange's MO of disrupting the government's conspiracy of authority. I don't think he wanted Trump to win; he most likely wanted Clinton to win and for Trump to delegitimize the political system.",7,/Negative/,Negative,0.75

Propaganda is information, especially biased or misleading in nature, used to promote a political cause. So with that definition out of the way, we can look at the information ""released"" by wikileaks and make a determination based on the evidence we have today that they were in contact with and advising the Trump campaign on what to push as news stories.

As an organisation that ""prides"" itself  on it's transparency, Wikileaks aided one political campaign in it's push for victory by timing releases of the Clinton emails whenever damning criticism of Trump came up in the MSM. If the organisation was actually being transparent and honest, it would have released the entirety of these emails in one go as a matter of public knowledge. But they didn't. They have continued this course of action to the present, with the ""release"" of the uranium 1 documents coincidentally timed with the Arrests of Manafort and co and the revelations of Papadopoulis's evidence that are hugely damning to the Trump campaign at large. This is propaganda. This is using truthful information in a biased way. The MSM is completely guilty in this too. But you know where they're biases lay.

The other question is where the info came from. Whistle blowers should be protected if what they are doing is done in the interests of the general public. What should not be scoffed at, is the possibility that the information was disseminated by a foreign government. That should make you uncomfortable because then it opens up a larger question of ""What did this government look to gain from releasing this information secretively?"". There is already a large, by all means circumstantial, connection between the Russian government, Cambridge Analytica and it's work in both the US presidential elections and the UK Brexit vote. The simple fact that there is a massive network of russian run bot accounts on the social media network that is both Pro Trump and Pro Brexit is disconcerting to say the least.

 The Obama Administration claimed that Wikileaks had become an arm of the Russian government when they assisted Snowden's escape from Asia and into the care of Russia.
