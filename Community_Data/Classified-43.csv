I actually believe this argument and in the Uk we spend more money each yeah on financing our debt than we do on educating people, if we didn't spend 45Billion (about 7% of government spending or 3% of the economy) paying debts from the past - then its true we could spend this money on something else.

There is a fair argument to say borrowing an extra 2Trillion dollars will put america in a worse place than not borrowing this money.

They gain wealth through asset price appreciation which increases exponentially over time from having total ownership of the means of production. People need to go back and look at the theories of Karl Marx. It is all about how the wealthy control the means of production.Rich Capitalists become wealthy and stay wealthy because they control the means of production and use it to exploit their workers for continuous gains. Capitalist wealth only increases over time because they rob their workers on a daily basis by controlling the means of production. They are modern day robber barons. You could set the income tax to 100% and billionaires would still be billionaires. When the Walton-Family inherited $200 billion from the Wal-Mart fortune they didn't pay a dime in income tax because it is NOT income. They oligarchy is playing us for fools. Income tax actually shifts the tax burden onto the working class. Wages are for poor people. When you tax wages it is really just taxing the poor. The billionaires are laughing at us. Here is the real solution. To reduce ECONOMIC inequality we need genuine wealth and asset redistribution. We need to go after their hedge funds and their stock portfolios. Tax corporations and tax estates so billionaires can't pass on their assets to their children. Go after their tax havens disguised as fake charities like the Gates foundation and the Rockefeller foundation which has been around for 100+ years and never helped anyone.
