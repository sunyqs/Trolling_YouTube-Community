Are they going to accept the Public Holidays afforded to BELIEVERS, and they going to accept the Penalty Rates of wages for working on those Religious Holy-days?You fools and hypocrites!

And marriage is not exclusively religious. It's also a government institution which affords certain tax benefits and a set of rights and privileges to the couple. For example, it allows a someone to make medical decisions on behalf of an incapacitated spouse. If the same-sex couple is not officially recognized by the government as being married, the decision normally falls to next-of-kin. Imagine a scenario where an openly gay man is in an accident and slips into a coma. His injuries are serious, but treatable and his life can be saved with medical intervention. The man's his common-law same-sex husband of 15 years is not allowed to make the decision. In steps the parents, who happen to be religious fundamentalists that disowned their son for being openly gay. And the parents elect to save their son's eternal soul over his life because of their religious beliefs. It's not exactly a far-fetched scenario.I can't say if the LGBT community would care or not if they got the same rights by another name, but they deserve the rights and privileges on the basis of equality and fairness.",5,,,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.6

The problem comes up because there's very little distinction between the ceremony and getting the rights.Hetero couples who've been living together with kids for years don't get full marriage rights unless they go through some variation of the religious ceremony. At a bare minimum, they have to appear before a judge in a small private ceremony. Until they do that, they're considered common-law partners and are denied certain rights.Same-sex couples have to find a judge or minister who's willing to perform the ceremony, which can be exceedingly difficult in red-states. Plus some of those couples want the big-ticket ceremony at a church with a ton of guests and a 5- or 6-figure price-tag.

It started long before the actual plebiscite. The daily bile of anti-gay based posts that the Murdoch press moderators tolerated was like being beaten up by thugs again and again. They not only provided a platform, they had a group of journalists who regularly wrote opinion pieces dressed as news articles that stirred the conservative base, providing them with daily grist for their anti-SSM grievances. And, when the postal vote campaign began, I strongly suspect they manipulated the comments sections of their papers to favour 'No' supporters by tactics such as delaying publication of 'Yes' comments, giving heads up notice to 'No' campaigners of some 'Yes' comments that meant when the 'Yes' comment was published it was ""drowned"" by prepared 'No' rebuttals that pushed the original 'yes' comment off the page at the same time it was published.",2,,,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.51

Gay marriage could have been legalized with a simple Act of parliament (as it now will be), but the Conservatives wanted to make a debate out of it hoping that all the bigoted Haters would keep the country in the Dark Ages. Conservatives politics is essentially just ""Apocalypse politics"" - they always argue any change will cause an Apocalypse tomorrow so everything should stay the same (convenient too, since they have the power and own all of societies assets and have the most too lose from real change). The actual truth about the Plebiscite was essentially to identify the Extreme Right Wing clique in the Liberal Party and purge it - Malcolm Turnbull is actually somewhat of a Lefty, or at least a Centrist, and is currently fighting to hold onto his power in the Liberal Party against Tony Abbott and his Far Right cronies. He believes (quiet rightly as polls show) that a majority of the rank-and-file Liberal/National Party members support progressive causes such as gay marriage, and by doing this he has allowed them to express their opinion and give him a mandate to legalize it without too much controversy.  Major backfire for him though - a number of MODERATE/CENTRIST Liberal/National politicians are now pushing for a Banking Royal Commission, which is a major hit on the Liberal Party and Malcolm Turnbull. ................In the end, he should have just passed an Act to legalize gay marriage.....he has caused this coup by making a circus out of it, which has backfired fantastically :)This could be the catalyst for Tony Abbott to make a comeback and oust Turnbull before the next election.",0,FALSE,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.484

Or you can do a plebiscite, which is like a referenda but it's for legislation rather than the constitution. The original wording of the Marriage Act didn't specify the sex of people getting married so the conservative government of the time was worried��it didn't preclude same sex marriages. They unilaterally changed the wording in 2004 to include 'man and woman'. So, really, all we needed the government to do was unilaterally *change it back*. But the current conservative PM has attained his position with the support of a small cabal of far right neocons who oppose same sex marriage. If he'd moved to change the law, he would have lost their support and no longer be PM. So to delay things, he announced a plebiscite. However,�� it was clear the majority of Australians supported same sex marriage and a plebiscite is legally binding. So instead of a plebiscite, they wasted money on a goddamn non-binding opinion poll that only told us what we already knew.

Marriage is NOT strictly the domain of the church, as evidenced by the fact that most civilised nations have civil ceremonies.

None of the things you mention require the animal to legally consent nor even consent colloquially.This is a losing argument. Consent is required in all situations. Any situation where you are presenting an option for someone to do something must have consent. Just because we don't go to the trouble of preparing a formal contract does not mean that consent is no longer needed. If this were the case I could force my friends to do whatever I wanted them to do, regardless of their wishes. Try as you might you will not be able to think of a single thing that you can ask another person to do that does not require that they agree to do it before they do it, even if that agreement is tacit. The only conclusion here is that we don't bother with consent from animals. Why would this be? Because animals are not capable of understanding the concept of consent. I would argue, however, taht any time you make an animal do something that it does not want to do, you are violating it, as it is refusing consent in its way. This would especially apply to leading it to the slaughter house. We could also argue that raping babies is fine because they can't give consent either way.

For example, preventing monopolization and having trust-busting laws is logical and there are measurable and displayable reasons to have them.But something like banning gay marriage - with absolutely zit and zero reasons and an overall net-negative outcome - is pointless; its moral posturing for absolutely no reason besides the fact that some people disagree with it. I do not consider disagreement itself to be an argument or a reason to ban something; ""I don't like it"" is your problem, not mine or the people that your ban would effect.My point being that this does display a difference in ideology between the people that support marriage equality and those that oppose it; the latter is more socially authoritarian and likely doesn't think in terms of what is best for the freedom of society, but rather what they want the world to be like even at the cost of freedom.",0,,,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.871

An opinion is not an argument though, and as far as i'm concerned - being socially libertarian - unless there is an actual reason to oppose homosexual marriage, I would not place unneeded power within the state.So what say you?

That is to say, it has been used for political and economic purposes besides that of bearing children, and to neglect that fact is a glaring omission.Some of the legal benefits of marriage - welfare for example - could be argued from your point of view, but even so those are only some of the perks of marriage, not all. Inheritance rights, monetary and property exchange, etc, are all faucets of marriage that aren't exactly welfare, but are legal perks recognized by the courts of law.Your argument only works as so far as welfare is concerned in its intended function to assist childbearing families and not in regards to the other legal perks of marriage which are completely abstinent of reproductive intentions. And even so, you also glaringly omit the fact that not all marriages - even those between straight couples - bear children, and seemingly have absolutely no problem with said families also recieving those benefits. To remain consistent with this logic - assuming that I understand it correctly - you'd either need to invalidate all marriages that do not bear off-spring or restrict government financial assistance to a separate channel of revenue, exclusive from marriage. My personal recommendation is actually quite different from most of my position and probably most of yours; I say remove marriage from the law entirely.
