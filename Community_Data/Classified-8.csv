Reagan even armed drug dealers and helped lay the ground works for the rise of South American drug cartels while founding the failure known as the war on drugs. (The Iran Contra, which consisted of Reagan committing treason and perjury but Republicans forget the entire event ever occurred). Not to mention Reagan and Bush being the regime that placed Saddam into leadership in Iraq in the first place and ignoring the fact that Reagan had an incident around 50 times worse than Benghazi and was an assualt not on consulate office but an actual military installation due to poor security details or that the Republican party allowed the largest terrorist attack on US soil due to ignoring intel and a president who loved spending more time on vacation than any president until the new one, which has taken a very lax stance on domestic terrorism. So really the American people have been ignoring a rapidly growing trend of the Republican party, while the party itself has been pushing itself further and further from any semblance of actual morals and instead on being a sham of any dignity it once stood for.

He owes China over $650 Million and it is believed that he owe Russia even more than that. They own him. That is why he as been kissing Putin's ass. He also has been laundering money for the Russians and Iran which is treason. This does not count all the horrible deals that is children and son-in-law are involved with.

So, it all depends on what you call successful. As an honest business man he is a failure. As a dishonest crook he is successful so far.

Also, we should scrutinize any political players who are shilling for an economic special interest, across the board.

If we're buying into the idea that the US is getting screwed in the world economy, we've got to find a new role in the marketplace, and develop new industries. Armorer to the world is nothing new for us, there's only so much benefit we can squeeze out of that industry.

First we don't even necessarily produce what trump is selling. For instance look at the Saudi weapons deal trump made during his first trip there, the company who would provide the weapons for sale, Lockheed Martin, said they would be making the weapons in Saudi Arabia. In fact there are plenty of job openings in Saudi Arabia for Lockheed Martin. 

Second the economy, as it relates to the average citizen, is barley affected by weapons contractors even for the employees who actually do all the work. For instance where I live there is a factory for the production of airplane parts, the employees make slightly over minimum wage and work extremely long hours in very hazardous conditions, and rarely see any benefits outside of their standard wages despite any number of large contracts coming into the company. 

Third even if our economy is booming we would not see free college or any other social benefits from our taxes. This is because Republicans and bought off Democrats try to cut these programs to justify deficits caused by over spending on the military, corporate welfare, horribly unbalanced taxes, and other useless money sinks.

Fourth us Americans don't need an ""emotional oriented"" leader, we need an uncorrupted intelligent leader that will take care of the people and hold those with most if not all of the power in our society accountable, and that sure as heck isn't Trump by any stretch of the imagination.

China understands this leaves a gap in which China can benefit from, taking on a new leadership role in universal trade deals.

I came to this conclusion after a lot of thought; particularly about how to cut the military budget but give the cuts a valid reason.

Here's why I think it's in the US's best interest to leave NATO:

1st:  Without being in NATO, none of the countries can come to us to fight their battles for them
2nd:  We would be able to destroy ALL the military bases all over the world; won't need them anymore to watch 'enemies'
3rd:  Since we would no longer need to run to all these countries's aid in war, we won't need an over inflated military budget
4th:  We would no longer have to send our soldiers to die in wars that AREN'T OUR PROBLEMS!!
Last:  We would cut into the military industrial complex's stocks and revenue in an ENORMOUS fashion

His claim being that these countries should pay up to defend themselves and not count on American assistance. 
Why should countries allow America so much influence in Europe if they behave in such a threatening way? After all it was America who created this situation by seeking to dominate NATO as it has. We in Europe are not responsible for the ballooning of American defense spending and do not have to do the same. European NATO countries already massively out number all it's possible enemies on the battlefield particularly Russia, in quality as well as quantity.
What exactly does all this money get spent on?
It seems that was always the point, JUST SPEND MONEY. Then of course it was revealed that not only the demands to spend more but that Americans wanted to see it was spent on the right things. All followed by insulting and sneering comments about European manufactured weapons and systems.
The clear strategy it seems was to force Europeans to spend more and for that to be only on American manufactured weapons. If we are going to spend more it will be to push American influence out of Europe. It will be on better science and engineering in Europe. It will provide Europeans with jobs. Why should we subsidise America's overblown arms industry?

I don't even disagree with that, because it isn't like the US hasn't done that in the past and it will continue to do so into the future. Weapons exist, so someone has to make and sell them. How am I doing so far? Has your assumption paid off yet?

Before I go on I'll just remark that I always take TYT with a grain of salt, because frankly they're a little too overtly bias for the left and I've seen them make errors. I do consider myself a leftist, probably farther left than most. Regardless I want accurate information, not preaching to the choir. 

Now that we have that out of the way. You seem to be asserting that they are saying that making weapons is bad and they should not be sold to other countries because weapons are evil anti-flower loving things blah blah blah, and that is their argument against Trump in this case. But, nothing like that is ever said throughout the video, there's nothing about denying the reality that the US makes arms and sell those arms. The main point brought up is not being a moron by having the oversight of those sales done by a department that doesn't have the experience required to determine whether or not those weapons are going to someone who could be a potential threat out of a short-sighted desire to sell more of them.

And then the slightly more subjective point of how sad it is that Trump is going around trying to sell weapons to people like a door to door salesman who gets the door slammed in his face half the time because he's desperate for approval. But like I said, that's pretty subjective and not of any significant substance.  

So in summery, selling weapons is a reality that exists, and that's fine. Just be smart about it. And... you're ugly. Or something, since apparently personal appearance seems to somehow add value to an argument according to you.",2,/Negative/,Negative,0.916

This isn't true though.  When those companies win, the US also wins.  We all benefit from their success; that's because they bring more money into the american economy.

money is only as valuable as the things it is traded for and when it simply sits in the bank accounts of billionaires it is completely worthless. when Trump rigs the tax system so that poor and middle class get wrung dry while giant corporations like oil and the weapons industry get a steady stream of government money it destabilizes the US and foments unrest.

like i said, you cannot change it unless you have a revolution. how about learning about it instead of trying to do something to it that cannot be done. 
and i will teach you something about morals. morals is a word that changes everyday according to how some think. and 2 persons can have different outtakes on what is moral. an example is back in the day it was alright and moral to stone people, but today says that stoning is not moral at all. but wait, some countries says it is alright still today. so who is right? lmao, 
if you read the constitution it is put in place so the government does not become a big government, learn about it and why the bill of rights was put in place and connot be changed. if you are wanting to change it, it would mean that you are for a big government.. if you dont like it then move to another country.
the issue with our government is not the constitution, it is fair and balanced, it is the ones that are running it that is ruining this country. now the people in the government can be reformed, meaning change the people in it just like Thomas Jefferson said. but that is another story in itself. bottom line is the people in government has become so corrupt and is not following what our founding fathers had put in place to protect the people right to be free.
i am neither republican nor democrat as both parties are really that stupid and radical about their thoughts. i am for the party of the CONSTITUTION OF THE USA. so who's side are you on?

1. The more weapons there are around, the cheaper they get. So even if the weapons the US sells don't end up in terrorist hands, flooding the market makes it easier for terrorists to get their hands on other weapons. 
2. Weapons of war have a direct impact on a nations capabilities and influence. Any object of trade of similar significance (such as, say, uranium) is treated apropriately. It's not just an object of trade (meaning it's regarded as nothing more than it's material worth), but as a political asset.
