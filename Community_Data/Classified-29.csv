The people pushing for this are either extremely misinformed about the realities of economics as it applies to those earning below 50K per year or incredibly horrible human beings.  The most prosperous period for the US was the highest taxed because it paid for veterans' college and housing (and heavily subsidized it for the rest).  The middle-class bloomed, workplace injuries declined heavily because of workers' unions, the US catapulted to the top of the world's economy.  Now, we've fallen because that which brought us the great depression has reared it's head 3 times between 2000 and 2008 because of deregulation and tax-cuts.  The only reason we aren't back in a great depression is that we'd climbed so high it was hard to fall that far all at once.  Thanks to mergers and lack of funding and corrupting of the regulators we're likely to see another soon since the big banks and their allies almost openly do money laundering and fraud on a regular basis and only get a wrist slap with no-one going to jail.  

It pains me greatly, but I've been thinking of selling my properties and moving somewhere sane.  Justice Democrats and Wolf-Pac have given me some hope, but not much.  The system is so corrupted, even to our news media is almost exclusively people with no morals, willing and eager to cherry-pick data and gloss over glaring inconsistencies and contradictions, fawning all over the politicians and lobbyists even after they've lied to these called journalists' faces the few times they actually point them out.  Of course even that is often too much and they're soon fired and replaced for even those small attempts to get some truth out.

The Republican and Democratic parties have long been filled with dirty tricks, giving mostly lip-service to democracy, and during the last primary it was shown that the Democratic Party has removed democracy from their process almost completely, even more thoroughly than the Republican Party.  The difference between exit polls and the vote tallies is way beyond what we call obviously manipulated results for other countries, past the point where our government would declare them no longer a democracy.  We're at the brink of losing our democracy completely, almost to the point where a physical revolution would be necessary, but that isn't really a possibility with how many people still believe the propaganda. I still have some hope that those on all parts of the political spectrum, from the tea-partiers to the progressives can weed the corruption out of the parties but not much.

The right wing parties have spit on the left for a century and one of them uses us when convenient or beneficial to themselves and rewards us a few half measures or some social changes after it becomes popular (gay rights for example, only half of what we needed to do was done by the liberals and only after it was popular and public pressure caught up to them) it's hard to be nice when your movement has fought hard for a century and we've achieved more than most would realize although not nearly enough has been achieved only a fraction, still many basic protections you may take for granted were fought for by us, and during our fights in the early 20th century and late 19th century the liberals and conservatives spat on us until it became too overwhelming for them to deny us on certain things, we've had two Presidents you could actually define as being on the actual left for sure, Carter and FDR, they held some naiveties that progressives tend to hold though (as that's what they were, progressives) but FDR in particular achieved quite a lot and was ready to do so much more after WW2 he had a second bill of rights he wanted to give the people, it would've done so much for us in our struggle against the system. I can't even begin to explain everything man because the average Americans mind is warped so much I have to go into way too much detail and talk about too many different but interrelated things in order to paint them an accurate picture. 

I'll talk more about guns later as I'm tired and sleep deprived now, but essentially know that most people on the left don't want to ban guns, we want to regulate them further, many on the left think that prohibition doesn't work (especially when it comes to drugs) so instead we think of ways we can put more safeguards and social programs in place via regulations and other policies, having a better regulatory system for guns is only one part of the equation to solve the issue of gun violence though. A whole lot of other stuff needs to be done as well, but the debate will always remain on guns between liberal politicians and conservative politicians because actually solving the gun problem isn't beneficial to them, it serves as a distraction and a polarization tool.",2,/Negative/Hate/,Negative,0.612,Hate,0.25

EVERY system rations care!   It is just a matter of how,  your system is rationed based on need and ours based on the size of your wallet.

The wait times you refer to are for elective and non critical surgeries.  There is no significant wait time on critical life or death issues and your wait times on critical care needs are not problematic. 

On the other hand the rich here can rapidly get hip surgeries and vasectomies while 45,000 Americans a year die because of a lack of any access care outside emergency room visits.  643,000 go bankrupt directly because of medical bills,  80 percent of which have insurance.  Both of those numbers are zero in Canada.   

Let me use your numbers rounded flat as an example why your system makes sense.  Your numbers above roughly show that for average earners of 50,000 they pay far less than the family in the US does, basically half.  Lets say they save 3k (7,000 us (with huge deductibles - 4,000 cdn, no deductibles), that amounts represents 6% of their gross income, forget about the trouble if they need to access care.   A quick look at difference between them and their more affluent Canadian and the American counterparts making 100k shows the Canadians pay 3% (8400 us (average us rate) - 11,400 cdn) more as percentage of their income than the Americans do.

Also, companies only raise their prices by a few cents when taxes go up, stop making it sound like they're going to double prices.  That's a con by the companies themsleves to justify them raising prices well above market value, and keeping them there.

Remember when grocery stores kept saying they would have to raise the price of milk from $1 a gallon to $3 a gallon because of gas prices back in the early 2000s?  When gas was around $1.20 a gallon, and then wen't up to almost $5 a gallon?  Yeah, well when gas prices wen't back down to Sub $2 a gallon, the prices on Milk didn't follow it back down to $1 a gallon.   It stated at $3+ .

When the price of gas quadrupled, did the wages of employees quadruple?  No, they stayed the same.   Your ""economic"" cause and effect would stipulate that an increase in profits from the company would transfer to their employees and customers, but it did not.

This is the con of corporate Econ, making people believe that its in your best interest to not ""force"" them to increase their prices.  Like they don't just increase them regardless of these things anyway.",2,/Negative/Worry/,Negative,0.526,Worry,0.241

Everyone's favorite boogie-man, George Soros has nothing to do with this channel.... 
And all news is sponsored content.... Very few are purely subscription based.... 
Also completely independent media is no guarantee of quality assurance.... 

And about ""salty"" and ""butthurt"" being terms coined by the alt-right or ""alt-lite"", as you put it.... 

From Etymonline:

salty (adj.)
U.S. slang sense of ""angry, irritated"" is first attested 1938 (probably from similar use with regard to sailors, ""tough, aggressive,"" attested by 1920), especially in phrase jump salty ""to unexpectedly become enraged."" Related: Saltily.

And the earliest use of the term butthurt was in a comment on. H.R. Giger's website in 1998....",0,/Negative/Worry/,Negative,0.453,Worry,0.237

My info comes from a few places.  Actual household incomes from people in multiple ranges of wealth and or poverty-like areas and such.  In addition, I get it from listening to people talk about their money and how they live.  I observe the price of living costs versus before mentioned incomes and conversations.
Stay on the surface of things and you'll see the truth a lot more than obeying lies.  That's how I do things.
$35K isn't middle-class.  In the 80's and 90's YUP.  Today, it's roughly 44K, where in the 80's and 90's $50K was upper-class.  Now it's more like middle middle-class with a few great benefits; depending upon how you live.
We are roughly 33K annually, and we are just above the redline each paycheck.  If not for help from my mom, we'd be 160 below the redline.  I'm sick of rice, and applesauce with a brake up of cheap ""quality"" meats.",0,/Negative/Worry/,Negative,0.437,Worry,0.239

The middle-class is a class I don't give a damn about.

NO I didn't the dude back.  Middle-class people need to stop living beyond their means and living with ""what would the neighbors think"" syndrome.  People call me jealous but I'm not.

I definitely feel you, man. I'm part of the Working Poor, I know that much. It sucks to know I'd still be poor but better off not having gone to college. It didn't pay off, and I owe a lot.

Ooooh.  THAT is where things can get messy. :)  I like that range though.  It actually fits the odd rich to wealthy are here.  Check this out: 50K people try to live in the cheapest upper class houses.  The price of these homes, make 50K people look like 30K people with no problem.  They struggle trying to be cute.
27-34K people try to live in what should 17K people homes, but struggle.  We are one of them.  100K people live in homes that run from 500K to over 2 million, and they are well off due to tax cuts and tax writ-offs (spelling).  The reason this happens is because a few 17K people will get a home for 33K and do well until... one bails. lol.  Your range is messy in an intriguing way, not a bad way.

You could make $250,000 but what if to make that you spent $80,000 in salaries and equipment? 

Then after Federal and state taxes on your $170,000 you probably were left with about $135,000.

If you’re cost of living is $70,000 (metro area that is a mortgage and cost of living  modestly for a family of 5)

You only had a business net profit of about $55,000 which seems like a lot but it’s not even a year of of operating capital for your business, just enough to cover emergencies and a few months of living or business expenses.

So as messed up as it sounds, $400k is still middle class...

It’s just the difference between being a salary employee vs being an employer with 2-3 people who work for you part time or full time.

Unlike employees, anyone with a small business has to spend 30% or more of their money to make money and then pay 20% to 35% of that in taxes.

When I started making money on my business, it required me to spend almost as much as I used to make when I was an employee.",0,/Negative/Worry/,Negative,0.53,Worry,0.252

demand is what pushes economies...  you can have all the supply in the world but if no one can buy your supply then the economy tanks... equally so if there is more demand than supply this can produce a chaos effect if the supply is something like food/water... but i would rather live in a country where there is more demand for products than there is a supply than having no demand and all the supply because that usually means people start dieing... 
what we need is for the people to have enough demand for long enough without the corporations corrupting the government for the suppliers to give up with their incessant need for hundreds of millions in annual profits  and to finally start growing the economy... because you can't grow the economy if the biggest portion of the population can't put money into the economy to grow it...",6,/Negative/Worry/,Negative,0.666,Worry,0.237

Ugw7GnAHswJHeLNQkzJ4AaABAg,Return of Zeus,1 month ago,1511034654595,"The House of Colonna hold the continual position of Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne at the Vatican. They claim to be the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome and directly descend from Peter de Columna and the Counts of Tusculum. Cologne Germany was named Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium named for the Julio-Claudian family. The Colonna family use the column on their coat of arms which is a symbol for political power. The Colonna name derives from the Greek word kolona which means a column. The Columbus and Colombo names also derive from Columna and from Peter de Columna. Christopher Columbus was a relative of the Colonna family and he claimed America for Rome. Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa and was funded by the Doria banking family who are intermarried with the House of Colonna. America is named after Amerigo Vespucci an Italian explorer working for the House of Medici. Amerigo Vespucci created the term New World for the Americas. Novus Ordo Seclorum is Latin and means New Order of the Ages and is on the US dollar and US great seal. The Vatican City State is the only nation on the planet that uses Latin as an official language.

The Colonna's control the Colombo crime family and several Jewish mafia factions which also run Hollywood and Columbia Pictures for Black Nobility like the House of Colonna. They also have majority ownership over the Chicago Outfit. The House of Colonna control the Knights of Columbus which uses the Roman fasces symbol for its logo. There are many police officers and federal agents that are members of the Knights of Columbus. The Colonna family have influence over police and organized crime. The Five Families are covert business enterprises for the Italian Nobility and they use their mafia to blackmail politicians. Prince Prospero Colonna di Stigliano is the current head of the Stigliano branch and his wife Princess Frances Colonna. The Colonna family come from Alba Longa and established a branch in Salamanca Spain known as the Dukes of Alba which merged with the FitzJames family of England. Salamanca uses the column on its flag where the Dukes of Alba ruled. Diego Columbus married Maraa de Toledo of the House of Alba. The Colonna family are also related to the Coloma family of Spain which settled in Belgium as powerful counts and landowners.

Prince Guido Colonna di Paliano was a Commissioner of the European Union, Italian Vice Consul to New York City and a member of the Trilateral Commission. Jerry Colonna is a financier from New York City who helped to establish Silicon Valley. Jerry Colonna who is believed to be worth over 50 million started a small investment group called Flatiron Partners which was in the business of making billions for companies like JP Morgan Chase. Jerry Colonna is protected by organized crime which attack me whenever I mention him. Jerry Colonna appears to be used for handling their illegal transactions and for money laundering. The Colonna family came from Alba in Rome and Saint Albans was one of their agents who settled in Saint Albans name after him in England. The Roman Alban clan later created the Barons Romney that established themselves about 100 miles away from Saint Albans. The name Romney means Roman. The Colonna family ceremonially rule over Capitoline Hill which represents the political power of Rome's corporate empire.

The column symbolizes the political support that maintains their claim to governmental land ownership. Freemasonry uses two pillars or columns in their temples for the two Colonna princely lines of Stigliano and Paliano. Paliano comes from the Latin word Palus meaning a stake or support like a pillar. The Colonna family also intermarried with the Barberini papal nobility which use bees on their coat of arms. The Mormon Church was created by Freemasons from New York and Mormonism uses bees and beehives as a common symbol. Mitt Romney is a powerful Mormon and politician. Romney means Roman.

Interesting read, and I agree with cutting corporate tax rates. The one thing I disagree with - and this is actually a disagreement with both parties - is the bracket system of income taxes.

What would you say to the idea of establishing an absolute base-line tax policy, wherein every citizen of the country - regardless of income bracket - pays the same portion of their income respectively with the percentages determined primarily by means of negating the national deficit by certain amounts each year. 

This seems far more logical than simply decreasing income while the country itself is in deficit, and also avoids the class-warfare of levying heavier taxes against the wealthy.",2,/Negative/Worry/,Negative,0.379,Worry,0.257

My only concern with lowering the income tax is that the U.S. is currently in a pretty large deficit; its running on empty so to speak...

How would the revenue loss thus be made up? Or are you predicting that by decreasing taxes overall, the actual incomes themselves will increase and thus balance the system out?

I'll admit that I'm not very versed in economics, so how did Calvin Coollidge actually do this?

Demand is but only one thing that encourages investment, if there is an excess is capital stock then it creates a down ward pressure on prices. Its not pocketed by the rich you toothless buffoon.
