The whole seance thing was always fake everyone knows that just like Quija boards. But when you pick a sword up and stick it into a tree and then watch a monk from a third world country pull it out and twist it into a helix no one what's to believe that story is real even though they never went out to see if it is true themselves. So yeah fake psychics suck but come on the is not a definitive exploration of this subject and that is why I dislike the Adam ruins blank. They take any subject that seems easy to debunk with the pretense of being without confirmation baises but the entire series is about debunking information in a manner to appeal to mass public to make a profit off this presentation.

If science has the answers to everything... Why does a bicycle stay up? That's something science has yet to explain, yet that doesn't stop bicycles from staying upright.

Science is only the attempt to explain something to the best of our abilities, but it doesn't currently hold the answers to everything. You speak down to people as if you're the smartest person in the room which I can almost certainly say that's not the case. What are you working with.. a 122 IQ? Slightly above average? 

Also, there are facts, and there are perceived facts. Not 20 years ago, it was a ""fact"" Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492 and discovered America. Guess what? The actual fact is he never set foot in America. ""Science fact"" changes all the time. 

Now, I'm a man of logic, intelligence, and facts. But the fact is, we don't know much of anything about anything. And to sit and proclaim you know something indefinitely is just as ignorant as those you think you are intellectually superior to.

She's never, ever even remotely considered attempting to make money off of these things, and there's no real rhyme or reason to them... the way she describes it, every once in a while (and it doesn't happen often- maybe a handful of times throughout her life so far) she'll just get some thought in her head that she knows isn't her own - often it won't even make sense to her- and she'll get a sense of who it's from and who it's meant for. And in the times where she has passed the messages along, the response is always ""...how could you possibly have known that?"". And her ""messages"" ARE really, truly specific. 

So yeah... all that's just to say that I believe in a certain form of psychic ability, and I believe that when people die their energy IS still out there in the universe and can be picked up on by people who are sensitive/open to it. But yes, I highly doubt the people who exploit strangers' grief for money are the ones for whom that's the case :)",1,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.586

Measuring📏  intelligence is like measuring how pure-hearted someone is, it's just not something humans are capable of doing. All we can do is make educated guesses, for instance when someone purposely leaves someone else hanging on a high five their clearly the spawn of the devil moreover If someone says that The Emoji Movie had an original plot, was well thought out, and totally not a 180min ad which forced them to put the word ""movie"" in the title so you don't forget it's an actual movie, then they might not be too intelligent.

I said trivial knowledge because having a high IQ won’t help you out anymore in the real world than someone with an average IQ. Ok, I shouldn’t have said: ""trivial knowledge."" I should've said that the I in IQ is trivial, it should be called ""KQ"" [Knowledge quotient] after all “knowledge is power” but do you know how to use that power? When your environment changes can you use that “power” to survive? 

Imagine landing in a dry desert in the middle of nowhere with nothing but the clothes on your back, you might know a lot about desserts but can you adapt fast enough to find water and move toward where you think the nearest city is or are you gonna tire out from a heat stroke and not have enough energy to put that knowledge to use?

You think it’s impractical that you’ll get stuck in a desert randomly or even when you're prepared? Fine then what about if you randomly became a salesman and you have to sell some products that aren’t even special like paper, pens or something like that, could you get in the mind of your customers and make a pitch that’ll make them buy it even though it’s the same as any other version of that product or will you buckle under the pressure and give up?


What I’m trying to say is all the questions in the KQ ..uh I mean IQ test can be learned through studying and researching A LOT of things without needing any real-life experience, but guess what? A high IQ won’t give you that job, social life, house or skill you’ve always wanted, you have to earn that stuff hands-on.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.695

Which is true, intelligence is about HOW you use your knowledge which leaves a variety of ways intelligence can be defined but that's basically the backbone of it.

Even though we don't have a solid way to precisely measure intelligence the good news is that that's not something essential for humans to know, all we need is to know if this person is capable of doing whatever he/she signed up for which is possible.",2,/Negative/,Negative,0.48

It only has to do with how much you want something to be  true! Which can also just be because the actual reality is unbearable! Something that can happen, no matter how intelligent you are. (E.g. even a genius might reject reality, if it consists of permanently being locked up in a basement and raped, Fritzl-style.) That’s why wars always breed religion. (And why every terrorist killed breeds 10 new ones. But hey, for the military that’s the point, right?)
Look up how schizophrenia (aka religion aka superstition etc) works: People who can’t handle reality, ignore it, make up their own more comforting one, and then explain experiences based on their delusions, instead of the right way around. The more you show them things contradicting their imaginary view, the better explanations for why it is based on that view they come up with. Hence: Never argue with a schizo, because they you are responsible for that illness too! Rather, offer them a way out, that allows them to keep their self-respect/pride!",2,/Negative/,Negative,0.631

I said each aloud as I saw them to the woman sitting across from me. When I stopped receiving images, I took my blindfold off and she looked shocked. The woman told me that she often dreams about a white owl and that it's her mother, she also dreams about sliding down a path of silver fish when she travels in her dreams. She then told me that she majored in theater in college. When I asked about the second happy theater face she told me that she relies on her acting experience at work to get through days when she isn't feeling upbeat.

The amoral con artists who consistently win the Biggest Douche in the Universe contest, and people who genuinely convince themselves that they're psychic, or have some kind of ability.

It's the confidence apparent in the latter group that makes people think they're 'legit'. Now I'm not just going to say it's entirely impossible, there's a lot about our brains, how they work, where the energy of our conscious mind goes upon death, etc. that we simply don't know. 

Like most of human history however, we're just repeating the same cycle. Right now, we see these 'abilities' or 'past lives' as supernatural, just like we once thought the rain was controlled by supernatural spirits. Like the rain however, I would bet we'll eventually find a logical explanation for these seemingly supernatural occurrences, because it's happened Every single time before. There are a few cases of people with these 'abilities' that actually stump science, but all that indicates is that something we don't understand is going on, and as usual, we're assuming that it's supernatural.

Also some physics actually will know your name without you telling them. They use plants to find out your name. Not actual literal plants, but a person among the crowd who isn't known to be affiliated with the psychic. They would seem like just another customer like everyone else but in reality their sole purpose is to talk to the real customers and collect as much information about them as possible. So you would not only have to withhold your name from the person claiming to be psychic but also from everyone else in the room because anyone who tries to speak to you could potentially be the plant hoping to collect information from you. Also when you pay the phychic, as you often have to pay up front, you have to pay in cash otherwise they can get your name from your credit card or checking account. And make sure the name on your drivers license or ID card isn't visible when you take out your wallet. There are a lot of ways a person can know your name without you telling them.

Spirit as spirit. If they claim to be able to communicate with the spirits of the dead, then I see no reason why they couldn't communicate with the spirits of the living.

UgwLSE8xTNORFw3tg354AaABAg,Kai Durkin,1 month ago,1512432076046,"I’ve never been to a “serious” psychic, but every year my drama group goes to perform at this huge arts festival and the past two years we shared a venue with a guy whose act is a mixture of comedy and “mind reading”. At the start of the show each audience member was handed a sheet of paper with a number on it and 3 questions - I forget the first one, but the other two were “What’s an interesting fact about you?” and “What’s something you always wanted to ask a psychic?” - and told to write down the answers. Then the psychic came on from behind the blacks. He would “randomly” pick an audience member using a D100 (the numbers on the paper all matched a number on the die). He’d have a wee bit of comedic back-and-forth with the audience member, writing on a whiteboard all the while, then would turn the board around and on it’d be one of the answers you’d written on your bit of paper. 
He called on me at one point, and while he definitely cold read me for my interesting fact - “I’m sensing yours is an unusual hobby...uh, something physical? Something circus related? Yes? Juggling? No?” *turns the board around and the board says “unicycles” which is correct - but he then immediately turned the board back, rubbed out unicycles, wrote down something else and put it down. He asked: What was your question you’d always wanted to ask a psychic?
Me (an Avatar fan who hadn’t been able to think of anything better): What should I have for breakfast tomorrow?

He picked the board back up, turned it around and on it was written “Whatever I cook for you.”

Our acts were on pretty close together, which meant we saw each other in the dressing room a lot. Every day for the rest of the festival my drama group would try to guess how he’d done it - but he never revealed his secrets.

He also runs two midnight shows over the month, which are seances - card tricks, pendulums, ouijii boards etc. It’s an interactive scary show, with a plot (the seance slowly turns into you all trying to solve a murder by contacting the victim, an old college friend of the medium) and a big jumpscare at the end, but the most amazing trick he pulls is making you forget that this isn’t real; it’s is a show you paid to come see.

To me that’s what things like mediumship should be about: entertainment. They should be treated like magicians: you know it’s not really magic, but you’re still amazed by how they make it look like magic. Not making a profit off of other people’s grief.",2,true,3,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.582

There are counter arguments, but they usually boil down to one of the big 3 arguments, which are ancient.
1. Ontological argument, which is just silly.
Easily refuted, a god that created everything without existing would be greater than one existing.

2. Cosmological, there is something instead of nothing, it had to begin with something, that something is god.
Doesn't tell a thing about it's nature and it disobeys it's own rules, who created god ?
And, why can't something come from nothing ? god did.. apparently.

3. Design.
Probably don't have to go over this one.

But, it wasn't existence of god that Adam should ruin, it's the brainwashing.
That is easy, they aim for the kids, they cherry pick their scriptures and they really don't like us normal folks reading and interpreting the damned book for ourselves.
What can brainwashed people easily do ?
Kill everything that opposes them, a healthy mind can't torture non believers while thinking he's doing a good thing.

Look, when someone close to you dies, your memories of that person is ultimately all that's left of them (at least as far as we're concerned in this world. The if-s or what-s of afterlife is sort of a moot point to the living since there's a big ol' one-way door between the two either way)

A medium relaying a comforting message from a loved one to a survivor is a problem because it's erasing that memory of the person. It's homogenizing it, removing authentic memories of a person, or at least the remnants of a memory that naturally formed, and replaces it with a shallow impression of the person. Sure your memories are never 100% accurate and distort over time, but it's STILL better than what's essentially turning your loved one's legacy into a sock puppet. 

That's not to say that all legacies need to be preserved. Perhaps some people really are better off with remembering a version of someone who never existed. But it's ultimately part of the costs involved. You're not just trading money to a medium at that point, you're trading your memories of a person in as well.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.637

The prize may no longer be a thing, but it was never shady.  The money was proven to exist and the challenge was properly scientific.  Also, it originally had no such requirements, they were added later because the amount of applicants became difficult to handle in a timely manner.

A ""psychic"" only needs to guess correctly once and you will believe they are psychic.

""I totally agree with Robinson Donazai, and you being so close minded won't help.""

Skepticism is not being closed-minded.  Is it theoretically possible that someone could have abilities that allow them to do something like reading minds?  Sure, in theory... though that has never been shown in practice, so I don't believe it is real.

""Check your facts.""

Check your own.

""They said John Edward was a fraud, but I see no proof of that.""

He was a fraud.  He used literally all the same tricks that ""psychics"" always use and some of the tricks used by faith healers.  He used the same tricks talked about in this very video.

""He continues to read and better peoples lives to this day.""

Research into his accuracy.  It is a mere few percent, less than 10%.  You know what else is that accurate?  Random guessing.

And even if people do feel better afterward, it is obtained through manipulation and fraud.  These people need real help, not lies.

""Make sure you do not feed into biased research, which is a large issue in society.""

Funny that someone operating using confirmation bias tells other people not to be biased.  Very funny indeed.

""I think people trying to disprove Psychics and mediums are the liars.""

Right, the people having the ""psychics"" try to prove themselves are the ones lying when they fail the tests.

Confirmation bias, indeed.

""They know there is no way to actually disprove any of it.""

It is easy to prove whether or not they can do it with empirical testing, just like science.  Proper, controlled studies make testing quite simple.

Guess how many have passed such testing?

Zero.  Literally zero.  Gee, wonder why...

One example that will always stay in mind, was when once I was sitting down in a cafe with my Mum and this random woman we'd never seen before walks up to us and says, ""Sorry to interrupt, but I couldn't help but come over and tell you that there are 2 men standing next to you watching you."" We looked around and saw no-one and were very confused. She then proceeded to describe their appearance.The description perfectly fit my Mum's father and brother, both whom had passed away, her brother the year before in a car crash. Needless to say, my Mum she was brought to tears. What we then found out, was that she was a psychic would could see spirits. Now, before you go all Mythbusters on my ass, keep in my mind that this was 30 years after her father passed away and a year after her brother did. She was close with both of them and their deaths took a heavy toll on her.

Do we lie to ourselves? Yes, definitely. But there are many different kinda lies of many different kinda natures that we believe in. Some of the lies, like ""justice"", ""mercy"" and ""ethics"", are actually important lies that help us grow as individuals and become greater human beings. Psychics, however, do not belong in that category of lies. Instead, they are lies on roughly the same level as santa claus; they may put smiles on young, dumb or unwise people's faces, but they're not actually good for anything other than scamming people out of their money... And as for you going on some rant about ""why read books?"" and ""why watch good TV?"" and ""why be happy?"" and ""why live?"" That's just substanceless, pretentious, pseudo-nihilistic, self-defeating bullshit trying to pose as thought-provoking justifications for your position while utterly failing to justify us allowing unethical behavior like the one scammers and psychic engage in.

You can compare ""lying to oneself"" vs ""psychics"" to ""being religious"" vs ""scientology"": It's fine to lie to yourself/be religious if it'll help you get through the day, but we shouldn't ever tolerate something as unethical as people scamming us out of our money in exchange for some lies that'll help us get through the day.

There is no such things as ""Legit"" psychics, if your mother was telling the truth (or at least what seemed to her to be the truth.) She must have gotten to a point in her life where she had convinced herself to lie so convincingly she even convinces herself. However, if she is simply lying (which is what is most likely happening) I would be very concerned that your own mother is lying to you in such a way. It could even be a sign of psychopathy. 
There is no such thing as ""Cosmic energy."" She could be referring to cosmic background radiation, however that has very little effect on anyone, and it would be stupid to assume it only effects certain people in specific ways.
Psychics and Mediums have already been debunked in the video. However Spiritual healing has also been debunked elsewhere. It is categorised as a form of pseudoscience. Meaning it has never been scientifically been proven to work.

I had several times dreams of things that happened the next day, and you CAN BE critical about it. I really was: I asked myself, as anyone eager to become a spiritual scientist, whether I was only autosuggesting it to myself or if there were simple alternative explanations (such as: this happens every day). But there weren't. It wasn't only for the fact that the thing I had a dream of was a very explicit and rare dialogue (about how tentacles of octopussies are disgusting and how anyone could eat them), it was also closely connected to it in time (the next day) and the dream itself distinct from usual dream experiences.

I think it is extremely arrogant to be so selective, by only picking the fake ones, by trying so hard to fit these phenomena into one's world view with such a certainty (it's okay to not believe it, but when you look at those cases where there are no ""mathematical"" explanations, then you should keep asking and not answering) …

As I said, please read Rudolf Steiner to get a very different view of what spiritual science can look like. He is the founder of this discipline, as all other spiritually gifted people embark this topic rather practically or romantically (even in a deluded way if not completely faked). In the past consciousness and spiritual development was different, so there was simply no n e e d for a spiritual science.  Then materialism took hold of religion (interpreting parts of the Bible as something physical) , before it manifested itself in development of the natural sciences.

1. Déjà Vu is not actual remembering. These two are very distinct. If you don't know this, then you really spent too much time on the outside world and should revise your introspection.

2. I could agree with you that he hallucinated his deceased aunt, as he told in his biography, especially because kids are generally more gullible than grown up persons. But this view completely ignores what Steiner experienced in all his later years, all the expedite accounts of the spiritual world. How could he have hallucinated or even made all this up?

3. You should maybe the Philosophy of Freedom, because even without believing in what Steiner said you cannot hold this position. »Science« doesn't necessarily mean pertaining to the physical world. The distinction between a physical and a »mental« world is, in itself, very artificial. Spiritual phenomena might not be expressed in mathematics, but that doesn't mean that they don't have any objective value. You have simply no ""right"" in declaring that. Spiritual science might be difficult, because you have to ""choose"" whom to believe, but that doesn't mean that one day more and more people wake up to the spiritual reality and become spiritual scientists themselves.

I guess what I’m saying is that I’ve had very uplifting times with my friend and I fully believe that she does what she does for the enrichment of herself and the people around her.

Aside from facts and opinions are beliefs. We use this term to differentiate what isn't or can't be proven from concepts based on feelings and things that can be proven.We need to have these to form a hypothesis before we can prove something.

Your asteroid example misses the point entirely. It's not about other people admitting something exists, but rather that it could exist. By sheer probability, assuming the universe is infinite and there are infinite universes, maybe there somehow is a sentient asteroid made of jelly that speaks french. However, considering Earth is the only planet with life that we know of and considering there's no imaginable way a giant living asteroid-sized life form could sustain itself in its conditions, it's too unlikely to give it much consideration if any. In fact it's so unlikely, that even if people claimed the french-speaking asteroid visited them or that they somehow saw it, it'd still be more likely to believe it to be caused by a list of more probable things before assuming it's that.

A psychic does not have the ability to know every single thing about a dead relative. It is an impossibility. They only have the ability to know some things, and 9 times out of 10 those things are extremely small and insignificant, nothing like what you see on TV. What you see on TV are called Readers.... people who read their clients instead of reading the dead. These people ask generalized questions and gauge the answers, both verbal and physical (body language is, in fact, a language), from their clients, and then proceed to make up crap about the dead based on those answers.

His mother was at a spiritual center (dont know if i translated this right, but its the building that kardecists meet) with other mediums and my friend who was together with her told me that they felt it too and they asked if my mother had a message to me. The message was that she is paying for what she did (it was suicide) and for me to not abuse of alcohol and sex, it seems like a pretty standard thing someone would invent.

Hate to break this to you, but what is fake about science doesnt come from disciplines themselves, it comes from the media that frames legitimate findings as something else entirely.

Actual falsification of data in experiments comprise very little of actual scientific data, and usually are found out pretty fast and struck out of said consensus.

Physics in particular is the most solid field in that regard, aside from the theorems that we later on could confirm or discard with further findings, most physics are built on thousands of years of science. And as a rule, all physicists hold true to one belief, and that is that not one rule is universally justifiable.

The first I met in New Orleans, who just told me about my unborn Son Julien, I was only in my first month, wasn't showing at all, let alone it being a boy, told me details of my past, names, dates events a couple I'd NEVER told anyone about, and she warned me to stay away from a creepy guy who I did end up meeting on Jackson Square and thankfully heeded her warning to stay away from him, he wound up actually stalking me for a few months :: yikes!:: and also predicted future events, but  said she could only see as far as his very early adolescence, but said we would be very close like twins, which we were, in retrospect, she seemed rather sweet but a bit sad at the ""end"" of the trading, maybe because she knew he would not live past the age of 13 😢... She never asked for a dime, bought me an orange juice and after that, we parted ways and I never saw her ever again after that... The second one I paid for, spur of the moment kind of thing at a new age shop, didn't know anyone there, and all she had was my first name. Almost immediately upon sitting down, she held my hand in silence (All I said was an awkward ""Hello"" to her) and, no joke, this woman asked me why is my Son (whom she described in exact detail, blonde, green eyes like my own, tall, around 13 or 14, handsome! He was!😖) saying ""I'm sorry Mommy! I'm SO SORRY!"" Before I could answer, she said, ""He's talking SO fast, but he is showing me a train, I'm sorry, but he's showing me that he took his life, on a train track."" She didn't ask me, ""Does that sound right?"" (It was exactly how he took his life several years ago.) She just said, ""He really wants you to know that he didn't see any other way out, there were some bully's involved who put up a video of him losing a fight with a smaller kid who hurt his friend. He wants you to know that he is SO, SO very sorry, but he's OK now. but he is worried about you. Etc."" HOW could a woman I'd never met know all of this? It wasn't all over the news, or papers... She even knew his name. Some future events came true as well, but my mind was blown by what she knew... I can't explain it, I'm a big time skeptic, however either these two women whom I DID NOT know at two separate times in my life were either freaking ""spies"" and I'm no one of importance, or, they were actually the real deal. I just WISH that if the first reader who came out of NOWHERE to deliver the message of my (at the time) unborn child was going to think that I couldn't help him out of a Cyber Bullying attack (he also had Asperger's Syndrome ☹️) and was going to commit suicide, that she would have told me and I could have had a clue to what happened, and the depression he did everything to hide...

UgwXok9P2-FmchdvCNp4AaABAg,Jacob IAm,1 month ago,1512432165212,"I can definitely tell you from my personal experience that both psychic abilities and psychics are real. 

It saddens me when people that have absolutely no experience with transcendental or entheogenic experiences desire to impart their faulty knowledge on the gullible masses which eat their lack of insight and information right up, simply because it conforms to their limited view of reality.

Reality is far vaster and more complex than you can imagine. Simply because ghosts or paranormal experiences (which are ultimately normal experiences, but remain para-normal until they will be explained by modern science- which they definitely will be in the near future) are not something you believe in or something you have experienced personally, even if it is not something that modern science has yet accounted for, in no way denies their existence.

From my personal experience I can tell you how I went to a medium after my grandmother died and was able to reconnect to her after her passing into the non-physical plane (astral). The psychic was able to give me such details of both the life of me and my mother, as well as those of the life of my grandmother, that there was no way there was no connection or psychic activity happening from her part. Not to mention my own ability to connect with her through meditation and how I immediately knew she has passed on while I was meditating - only to get a call from the doctors moments later sadly confirming her passing on.

Of course this is far from the only such experience that I've had which could be dubbed ""paranormal"". Many spiritual and entheogenic experiences of understanding the inherent oneness and interconnectedness of reality have also been a part of my life since I've started partaking in regular meditative and introspective practices about a decade ago.

Science is slowly catching up to what reality is and what various mystics have been saying for decades. How we are all interconnected in one huge unified field and how the whole cosmos is a holographic play created by consciousness (no, I'm not talking about simulation theory here, though in many ways reality does seem like a dream/simulation - though not simulated by a massive supercomputer, but by consciousness, the underlying intelligence present within and without all phenomenal existence).

If you want more information on how reality functions, you can look into various mystery schools and piece together the contents - the metaphysical teachings have been best preserved in Eastern mystical schools, but some western philosophers have come close to these truths as well (Spinoza, Schelling, Plotinus, even Plato, theosophists like Henry Laurency (a great read, highly recommended, Google Henry Laurency and you'll find his books)....etc.). The metaphysical teachings have also been to various degrees preserved in western non-religious mystical teachings such as the Qabalah, in Druidism, Paganism...

If you want a good run-down on how some of the absolute top scientists from various fields are making the para-normal into normal and explainable, I would suggest reading the book ""The Field"" by Lynne McTaggart. She is a journalist and has been able to collect and in layman's terms describe various scientific breakthroughs and discoveries that might be considered very ""fringe"" to most.

 It's sad to me that CollegeHumor is pushing an agenda and creating videos that have nothing to do with humour whatsosever. But it is as it is.

Much love to all of you, be well.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Positive/,Positive,0.711

As someone who's seen and researched psychic mediums (I was a big skeptic too), there ARE real ones, but yes, this is definitely how to tell if you're getting a cold reading. Unfortunately the first psychic I ever saw gave me a cold reading and while I wanted to call her out, I refrained. Another medium I saw though I felt more convinced, as she pulled out pretty specific details about a person I had in mind and how our relationship was without asking me any questions. The first one I saw however, asked me way too many questions much like in this video.

When somebody continually pays money to a psychic to get them to tell them vague tales of how their loved ones are saying hi to them from the afterlife, that's not allowing them to move on or grow as a person. Part of the process after a loved one dies is coming to grips with it, accepting that a big part of what gives life value is death itself, and to value the memories you have of that person. This false sense of ""Oh, they're not really gone"" is super bad for people psychologically, and psychics are taking advantage of people at their most emotionally vulnerable.

My seminar/participation grades are always my lowest by far. (I'm a lot better at reading between the lines of written instructions to figure out what the teacher wants and providing the right bullshit from that.)

I wonder if a lot of them are really convinced they're psychic because they're so skilled at it that they don't need to even think about what they're doing/don't quite understand where their conclusions are coming from. That's what intuition is theoretically, right? I have a strong intuition, but likely I'm just picking up on environmental clues that I'm not consciously noticing and piecing together conclusions from them.

As someone who had a spot-on intuition as a kid and even a couple visions (and as someone with a psychology degree now that I'm older), I'm very interested in what causes these experiences. Confirmation bias doesn't quite seem to account for how accurate they are, so I'd loved to know if there are some subconscious processes involved. So the person IS relaying accurate information, but is just misattributing the source (eg. to messages from the dead instead of their own guess based on subtle cues they don't consciously notice).

I no longer have those experiences though, so I also wonder if it could be the result of a brain malfunction that healed during my mid-teens. Or if higher education caused me to stop misattributing and also start ignoring the cues. Or if I've gotten stupider and just can't pick up on the cues as well anymore. :P

Basically I either got smarter or dumber, and I hope someone will research this more so I can know which. XD

I've also noticed anecdotally that ""psychic abilities"" tend to be inherited, which is likely due to parents passing on their beliefs and thinking methods on to their children who learn to mimic them. It also seems linked to a strong spirituality, which maybe causes the misattribution? Or, is faith/religion... oh gods please no one take offense I swear I don't mean it that way... a form of illness, mimicking the effects of brain damage?

Note that I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, even. I've heard sleep deprivation also mimics brain damage, and what it does to me is make me more creative and a better writer. O.o I'm just wondering if intense spirituality can invoke a similar temporary state of confusion and creativity, allowing disparate ideas to be linked and ultimately causing the clever subconscious conclusions based on subtle cues to be connected incorrectly to a source separate from one's own mind.

Or maybe I'm way off base, but regardless, it's a fun subject to ponder. I should probably get over my hatred of research and actually look it up some day but, ugh, traumatic university essay-writing flashbacks. :P I do take enjoyment in entertaining all possibilities though, no matter how absurd they may sound. So hey, maybe they're psychic and we just don't know because it's a huge conspiracy created by the universe itself, you see, to do different things when we're looking than when we're not. Therefore, strange phenomena such as these can only be witnessed when skeptics aren't watching. ;) :P Doesn't adhere to Occam's Razor though.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.594

I called you a hypocrite cause it is a very accepted knowing that everyone is psychic. have you ever had a gut feeling? have you ever just known that someone was about to call you? have you ever thought to turn left not right and you averted an accident? THATS PSYCHIC my friend.. being psychic does not mean you're a mind reader... it means you intuitively know, beyond scientific comprehension that something is correct/wrong. Which brings me to your valid argument of proof? why should there be proof? the proof is within you, and only when you find it you'll truly understand that.. one does not expand their psychic mind with numbers and theories, its achieved by letting go, trusting in yourself. Only TRUE gifted mediums know this. its like the path of buddha, in saying that you cant reach enlightenment unless you let go of attachment and accept suffering.. what I mean by that is - you will never find evidence, of spirit, or beyond by looking for it..externally of YOU. You only find it INSIDE you mind by believing. THEN YOU WILL SEE.. evidence is completely individual and cannot be comprehended in maths which you science morons somehow want..
Ive had my proof, I feel spirits, I hear them (no im not crazy) they dont tell me to rob banks, they guide me to be reasonable... I see things before they happen sometimes. This is personal proof FOR ME, NOT YOU... its my path, and its the gifts I require to find enlightenment.. you will have these gifts if you wish.
Ive visited very gifted mediums whom did not know my name, or my life, and upon reading with them they have told me things that no one COULD have known.. and I dont have facebook so its not like they're researching BS. Once again this is proof FOR ME.. you cannot see it and you will not see it, cause you simply choose not to.
Ill leave with one very simple thing for you to ponder on my friend -
If you are correct, And I am insane, Then when we die.....NOTHING... you wont be there to say ""SEE""
BUT, If I am correct, and you are blind, I wont be such an arsehole, Ill be there smiling for you, SO why use this lifetime, hating on people like me, that have found great meaning to live, and purpose through belief in higher divine order... that keeps me HAPPY, where as you whom simply choose not to, you belittle me/us? WHY?
are you so offended that I believe in my gifts, and spirit? 
man once did not believe a plane could fly, but in time it was shown...
In time, spirit will come to you (not all of us at once) and will show you... if you choose, other wise youll be left alone to think that their is ""no proof""
