Sorry, but apparently you're not familiar with the phrase, maybe because that too belongs to a bygone era.

Lets face it there are plenty of women out there who do consider perfectly acceptable to find a rich guy to provide for them (even after divorce in some cases). Now don't get me wrong I think that is a shitty situation, women should have a little self respect, they are bloody grown ups they can look after and provide for themselves but to pretend that isn't not only an option for some women but a goal is to be obtuse and all he did was highlight that this is one way women can use the power they have.

Moreover, the event is truly historic, as Mugabe has been in power for decades. It has many potentially interesting facets on the relation between economy and politics. 

They could at least report on the bare facts, as they do with natural disasters, Dueterte etc. But if they wanted to do some commentary, there is plenty, e.g:

1. Robert Mugabe was a liberation leader turned tinpot dictator, who was ultimately supported by the British when he appeared 'moderate'. He also presided over the massacre of 20,000+ supporting other liberation parties/leaders
2. He has tanked the economy, but also allowed for widespread land-redistribution, benefiting both his cronies, civil servants and war veterans, but also ordinary people erstwhile living in the overcrowded customary areas (rural areas under tribal authority, a hang-up of white minority rule days)
3. One consequence of the economy tanking is that the currency is now tied to dollar, and with few exports to the US, means there is always a chronic shortage of currency.
4. The coup was instigated when 'Uncle Bob', backing his wife 'Gucci Grace' for succession, axed the VP and began purging his loyalists. Also likely inflamed by the fact that state civil servants and soldiers hadnt been paid in months
5. The VP, now returning to the scene, is also apparently a mother-fucker from the war days. Some claim he will 'stabilize' the economy, but this would likely mean a transfer from corrupt nationalist third-world nightmare to corrupt neoliberal third world nightmare.
6. One of the reasons that the military s saying it isnt a coup, is because if it is the African Union and Southern African Development Community would be obliged by treaty to intervene, possibly militarily. South Africa might have to get involved, and has already sent 'envoys' (apologies to Warren Zevon).

UgwgmAtuwV7acHIx3yF4AaABAg,Nx Doyle,1 month ago,1510993230564,"My TYT intake is at its lowest point since 2014. There are a few reasons why. I've been enjoying the more restrained, considered analysis and commentary from David Pakman, whose interviews and longer form pieces I've very much enjoyed in the last few months.

To be honest, a couple of the reasons have to do with a certain disappointment in your presentation style. Ana, for example, seems unable to make it through a segment without mispronouncing something she's reading. My own broadcast background was from a time of far more rigidity when it came to reading content written by others. 

We weren't allowed on air until we had learned to pre-read every bit of copy etc. written by a third party. Sticky pronunciations were checked and memorized. It may be unfair of me to expect the same of others, but when a mispronounced word drops, it takes me out of the story immediately. 

Ana is not alone in this, but she does seem to have an uncanny ability, when winging it, to mispronounce even those words that have two colloquially accepted pronunciations. 

The one that comes to mind is from perhaps six months ago, Arundel (from Anne Arundel County, Maryland). The original Arundel is in England, but there's one in Australia too, with keying different between the two. My guess would have been that the American pronunciation would have conformed to the Australian, and so it is. 

But Ana, at sea because she clearly never pre-reads before air time, somehow managed to pronounce it following neither convention. Uncanny.

Beyond that, I've seen an increasing number of TYT segment headers lately that can best be described as troll titles. I expect trolling as revenue raiser from some, but until recently would not have included TYT on that list. 

But the biggest reason is content. There is so little investigative content coming out of The Young Turks. It seems as if everything you do effectively follows a standard pattern. Either someone from a cable news network or the news arm of a network says something you don't like and you react to it. Or you react to news generated by the mainstream media. Or, as in this case, someone appearing on a news network says or does something wrong, in your estimation.

I can look at the title of a segment upload, like this one featuring rock anachronism and lecherous, self-serving geriatric Gene Simmons, and I can take an educated guess what TYT's view will be. There's nothing compelling about that kind of content.

The common element is, essentially, that you are not generating stories, whether investigative or otherwise. Much was made of raising money to hire a team of lean, hungry, go-getting investigative bloodhounds. But I'm not seeing the fruits of labor.",4,true,2,,,,,,,/Negative/Worry/,Negative,0.563,Worry,0.254

The thing is, fox is walking on thin egg shells at the moment  and are obviously hyper sensitive to anything that is remotely sexy,  let alone sexual assault innuendo with all they have gone thru the past 2 years  with alies, orielly, Bollinger and on and on, 

So anything coloring remotely outside  of the lines is going to be meet with some serious  prejudice esp now with any and every male head is on the chopping block for a minor provocation from 35 years ago

So with gene being a big personality that take a up a lot of space in the room and living  a life with few limitations  ... his being banned was more of an over extension of precaution on the part of fox, then the rule of egregious bad behavior... I never got the feeling that gene intended to hurt anyone, he just wants to be loved, remembered and worshipped by all... and just over plays it to the max this his reputation
