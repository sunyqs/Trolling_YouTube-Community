You can't go around provoking those people like that!""  Here, you are claiming that women are provoking rape in the same way a rude person in a bar is provoking violence.  You are placing blame on the victim instead of solely criticizing the one guilty of a crime.  People have a 1st amendment right to wear what they want.  PERIOD.  No one is allowed to commit rape regardless of the victim's clothing choices.

Yes, if your behavior is to assault women for their clothing choices, you MUST change your behavior.  It wouldn't matter if a woman was walking down 5th avenue stark naked, you still have NO right to touch her.  What part of illegal behavior don't you understand?

And since you are so focused on reality, here is some reality for you straight from the field of criminology.  People do not commit rape because they are horny, or because they see someone attractive.  Rape is a crime of violence where the victim is selected based on their vulnerability, not their attractiveness.  The reported age range for rape is less than a year old to people in their 80s (I dare you to argue that infants and senior citizens are asking to be raped because of their sex appeal).  Rapists get off on the power high they get from forcing themselves on a weaker victim; not by any kind of 'attractiveness' standard that normal people use when selecting a partner.  Rapists often obsess over their victims for long periods of time and are often acquaintances with them.  They rape because they feel entitled to that person and want to satisfy that entitlement.

Problem is, you still defend your original criticism of the way women dress.  If you truly believed rapists are the ones completely at fault, you would retract your original argument.  But you're too stubborn and proud to do that; so you get all upset when I point out the obvious inconsistency of your defense.

Finally, you make this political.  You turned a women's social issue into  Right vs. Left when there was absolutely no cause for such a case to be made.  But if you are so hell bent on making an attack on women's freedoms a staple of the conservative mantra, go right ahead.  There is a movement going on in the US that is going to pit legions of women against your political agenda.  Enjoy Trump Nation while it lasts.",1,/Negative/,Negative,0.885

You can quote me all you like, but you still don't understand me otherwise you wouldn't accuse me of ""victim blaming"". I didn't need to be ""educated"" about rape and besides, everything you said about it is irrelevant: this video (which, apparently, you still haven't watched) is about women's clothing and about negative reactions stemming from one's choice of clothing which is why I've been talking about clothing all along. And, yes ... I continue to advise that women should not draw unwanted attention to themselves by the way they dress. Depending on the circumstances, dressing provocatively can be a foolish thing to do. This has nothing to do with ""ignorance"" (especially since you are the ignorant one, not me) it has to do with common sense.

I have maintained all along that I am not blaming the victim. No one ""called me out"" on it because that's what I've been saying from my original post. You make it sound like I've somehow been secretive about my views. Sexual offenders are guilty 100% for their actions. However, in the rare instances that rape is instigated by a woman's clothes, or, more commonly, when a woman's clothes draw unwanted attention like catcalls or groping, it is impossible to say that her choice of clothing didn't inspire the rapist or groper or whatever. I don't blame the victim for the actions of other people. If the rapist or groper or whatever is charged and brought to trial, he can't use the victim's clothing as a defense. This is an example of how the offender is held 100% responsible for his actions while absolving the victim of any and all responsibility for the offender's actions.

Finally, you need to stop lying about me and the things I've said. 1. I did not make this political. Quote one sentence of mine where I make this a left versus right issue. When you fail to find such an example, I expect an apology. I'm still waiting for your apology for falsely accusing me of hypocrisy, by the way.  2. I am not attacking women's freedoms. That's just something you pulled out of your ass, like you did when you lied and called me a hypocrite or when you lied about me making this political. 3. I did not vote for Trump because I believe the man is a moron and a pervert. I also believe that he should be removed from office via the mechanism provided for in the 25th amendment to the constitution. In short ... I am not enjoying Trump Nation. At all. 

For you, it's very different. If you'd just shut your mouth and open your eyes for a few minutes, you would realize that nothing I've said in this thread was motivated by politics or political party.

People do not commit rape because they are horny, or because they see someone attractive. Rape is a crime of violence where the victim is selected based on their vulnerability, not their attractiveness. The reported age range for rape is less than a year old to people in their 80s (I dare you to argue that infants and senior citizens are asking to be raped because of their sex appeal). Rapists get off on the power high they get from forcing themselves on a weaker victim; not by any kind of 'attractiveness' standard that normal people use when selecting a partner. Rapists often obsess over their victims for long periods of time and are often acquaintances with them. They rape because they feel entitled to that person and want to satisfy that entitlement.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.973

Study after study on the topic proves my point.  Rapists select targets based on vulnerability, not attractiveness.  So a woman's choice of clothing has absolutlely no bearing on whether or not she is at risk of being raped.  But both you and maya L assumed that it did, hence all of your uneducated rantings that I have been trying to correct.

Pedophilia is an abnormal sexual desire, wherein sexual gratification is only realized with a perceived younger (child age) partner.  By itself, it is just a desire.  Acted on an underage person, it is statutory rape.  However, not all statutory rape is an act of pedophilia.  Children are often targets of rape, not because the rapist is a pedophile, but because children are weak and vulnerable (which is what rapists use to select targets).

I'm not going to restate myself 1000 times because you can't read.

Arguing that it shouldn't be like this is like arguing that gays are homosexuals by choice. Which is not true. More skin you show, the more we can be turned on (by personal preference). You can't force women's perspective on sexuality on men's.

2: you don't concern yourself with other people's feelings when you dress: ok, so how about a fat dude who goes out buck naked? Showing genitals is only prohibited because it offends people, right? And connecting this to my first point: you also don't care about if that other people's feeling is a boner? Sure, you wont freak out if a guy walks around with a huge boner, right? I mean, why would he care if he makes you uncomfortable? Just like it's not your fault that he gets a boner, it's not his fault that it makes you uncomfortable. Your logic. Basically, you are being ignorant about basic biology, namely the reproduction of the species. If he turns on by looking at you, who's ""fault"" is it? Well, technically it's evolution's/god's ""fault"", but hey... it's not like it's a choice.

3: since the above 2 are concerning biological reactions, not much can we do about them.
HOWEVER
We are NOT animals. Therefore it doesn't matter how uncomfortable/horny a guy is, or how much he sexualizes a woman's body IN HIS HEAD, it's not an excuse to force yourself on another person.

If I were the producer, the show would start with a tutorial of common modes of female dress in Egypt. Just to see how easy it would be to prepare for a topic like this, I Googled ""Female Fashions in Egypt"". I found an article by a journalist, Olivia Katranjiand, who wrote that ""It isn't safe for a woman dressed in a skirt and blouse to walk the streets alone in Cairo. Expect to be harassed."" I looked at some of the fashions, and I didn't see razor slit jeans anywhere. In fact, what I saw varied between something like a female CPA would wear in an outfit like Price Waterhouse, but looser fitting and with more color, and what ""The Flying Nun"" would wear. Think about this: many of the Egyptian women feel compelled to cover their hair and neck with a ""hijab""''; while, others chose a ""niqab"" - the cloth equivalent of wearing a bag over your head. I could go on & on about this, but here's a sobering fact: ""Female Genital Mutilation was legal in Egypt until 2008"". More precisely, cutting off the clitoris and the clitoral hood was the starting point of the procedure. Once you know that fact, slits in jeans and bare skin in Cairo takes on a whole different meaning.

""women owe nothing to men. Just because we're polite and our ""signals"" are friendly, it doesn't mean that we have to give them anything""
I agree, but it gets complicated by the fact that women want (pretty much insist on) men being able to read their signals and make a move. Women often play coy and hard to get and they often WANT men to go for it. The fact is, these signals aren't always easy to interpret correctly so of course you'll have men hitting on women who don't want to be hit on. And whether a woman wants to be hit on or not usually depends on how attractive the man is (among other factors).

In my opinion ""politeness"" is simply a part of the social contract of the general respect we owe other adults. Not so much friendliness. Friendliness from a sexy, attractive woman such as yourself WILL be interpreted by the average man as a possible ""come on."" Of course that varies from personality to personality and we have to factor in (if we know the female) whether a female is simply a warm, gregarious, 'people person' in general. If we don't know the female then the 'friendliness' is perceived as a more definite signal.

No, ""rapists"" do. Women rape too, it's just not as common. The point however is that it's a tiny minority of men that rape.

Thanks for your answer. I understand where you're coming from and I agree that the underlying causes of such behaviors should be understood. 

I still think you're missing the point i was trying to make however. (I'll ignore the fact that women do rape as well and that this kind of rape will almost certainly be the most under-reported kind).  If you have behavior A and you determine that most instances of it occur in group Y, BUT only a very small amount of the members of group Y partake in behavior  A, you've not said anything particularly useful. In such a case, you CANNOT say that being part of group Y is the relevant factor here. The vast majority of group Y have no relation to behavior A. 
In other words, it's NOT ""a man thing,"" since the vast majority of men don't partake in it (not to mention that it isn't just men doing it in the first place). A much more likely common denominator would be something like scoring low on empathy tests or  tending towards being something like a sociopath.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.934

Just look at history of all major religions and how they use it to subjugate women.  The Salem witch hunts,  Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Mormons, and now recently, the damning evidence and words of the behavior of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. He calls himself a devout Christian and sees nothing wrong with raping minors!  Hollywood too, then we see it in Fox News, and now we elect a pig for a president of the USA. 
These men deep down inside feel they have the right to rape women. They are to be available for men's pleasure.  And religion enables this. It's tribalistic.  It's sustained throughout the world, and in western cultures and societies.  Frats in the USA, sports teams,  military (Tail Hook parties),  Corporations, Entertainment.  Japan is guilty of it,  India, UK, Italy, Nearly all muslim nations, China, African countries, Canada, Russia, etc. List goes on. 
Men in power don't want to relinquish this entitlement.  Women are simply meat to them, a commodity.  That's why sons are valued and heirs, while daughters are a liability and must come with a dowry to entice a man to marry them off. 
The World and it's myriad of problems won't go away until this one key problem is abolished.  Everything traditional is geared to blame and shame the female for all ills and causes of temptation.

If you cannot control your sexual urges and you end up attacking her, that is your responsibility. Her clothing has nothing to do with your choice to rape her. 
That being said, it is perfectly reasonable to criticise her choice of wearing that clothing in certain contexts, not on the basis of her morality or her right to do so, but for pragmatic reasons. If, for example, a woman lived in a region where the local gangs were known for raping women who went to collect water, it would be an unwise decision for a woman to dress in an alluring manner and then go through the gang territory alone.

But we should also call out stupid women or men that provoke and instigate trouble.  If a man had ripped jeans on that exposed half of his penis in public, should we be surprised that people might look or want to touch, or that others might call him stupid and question his sanity?

Absolutely the Egyptian lawyer is an extremist asshat, calling for violence and the rape of women based on wearing certain clothes.  But we should also acknowledge the concept of public decency and there are limits.  Other countries and cultures don't have the same limits or laws that we do.

Ugxo1dpCYdqZ3rwzsEh4AaABAg,Saurabh Malkar,1 month ago,1511035613183,"The clothes you wear will have some ramifications as you go out in public. If a woman wears extremely revealing clothes (the definition is highly subjective and conditional to culture), people will look, comment, and sneer. She will experience catcalling and, if she is in the West, unsolicited requests for dates/hookups. In the same way, if a man dresses up in drag and goes out for a drink, people will stare, sneer, gawk, and poke fun. Nothing wrong with any of that. What's wrong is to rape/assault the woman or man because of their clothes, something that happens a lot more in the East than in the West. The lawyers remarks were indicative of rape culture, not some extreme form of it. Rape culture exists in the middle east and some parts of south asia, not in the west.
As for the connection between clothes and sexualizing, we need to acknowledge that clothes aren't just for covering our bodies. Apart from several other psychosocial functions they serve, clothes are meant to titillate the opposite sex, usually, women using this feature, wittingly or otherwise, a lot more than men. Thus, a woman wearing a deep neck blouse and micro-mini skirt is not doing it because it's comfortable or warm or professional. It's done to attract attention. While such an attire will attract stares, winks, unsolicited requests, whistles, catcalls, it by no means is an excuse to rape.
Also, sexual impulses, a part of primeval impulses, are beyond our control. It comes from the ancient part of the brain. The actions, however, are under our control and the homo-sapien add-on of the brain should kick in and reign in the impulse to jump a woman and have sex with her.",5,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.652

If someone of bad education and with a material desire sees you leaving your home without locking the door, it can tempt him to invade your house; likewise, if someone of bad education and with a sexual desire sees you in a way which arouses him, it can lead him to invade your body.

Sexual assault is not only a domination issue, it's also a strategy issue. If you're in a forest of dangerous bears, and if you want to survive, you strategically compromise your freedom, you try to avoid their attention and to not excite them. You would agree that rapists are animals without the moral code; so, how can we deal with them in the real world, as long as our moral argument doesn't get hold of them, and before the police gets hold of them? We can strategically dress in a way which doesn't get their attention and doesn't excite them.

This is not to say that potential rapists can't be morally educated off their path. We should take steps to change the culture of domination.

Harassment= spank on the butt, not rape; educate yourself.
Rape means that spanking hand or penis has to force into way inside the woman's vagina, or otherwise have intercourse without his/her consent.(Men can be forced as well)

Meanwhile this means you're also laughing at women who were actually raped, some of which are left traumatized for life, or pregnant with their attacker's baby.  You're laughing at women who were dragged off or kidnapped, beaten within an inch of their lives, raped, and left for dead.  You're also laughing at women that were raped and murdered.  You're also laughing at the kidnapped young women sold into the illegal sex slave market, who will be brutally tortured if they talk about escape, let alone try to escape, and are never seen again by their families while locked up in a living hell.  You're also laughing at children forced by an adult who should have protected them instead, and the children used by pedophiles.

Laughing at the suffering in the world, based on a confused, ignorant assumption not based on reality, is not something you want to do.  Sure, you may laugh at the uppity sort of person who has such a chip on their shoulder that they freak out if someone merely taps their shoulder to get their attention.

A rape joke is not rape, but it's taking a tragedy and downplaying it so that it's no longer bad, but amusing.  I'm merely putting to question the mindset of a person who thinks the dehumanizing and suffering of a victim is an amusing topic, or at the very least has no respect for personal boundaries and the feelings of others.  A person who simply thinks rape is funny isn't necessarily a rapist, since they haven't actually committed the crime yet.  They can think all day about it, but unless they cross the line into reality and rape someone, they're innocent of the crime.  But their ""jokes"" do share something in common with a rapist's way of thinking; the seeking of pleasure derived from an act of cruelty against another person.
And yes, it is true that many rapists try to make sexual assault and sexual harassment seem like it's not a problem at all, and excuses for why it's okay; trying to validate it.  Some go as far as to mock their victims and laugh at them, or brag about it.  Once again and to help you out, if all you're doing is making jokes at the expense of the actual victims, you're not actually raping anyone.  But you're following the same type of mindset and/or excuses that people who abuse others use; and that's not always the wisest choice when interacting with other people, even if it's just verbally.

I also suggested that he think a little harder on the topic, and look a few things up so he can get his facts straight.  Rape is not a joke,  and treating a person like an object you can fondle and grope isn't appropriate.  In the modern world, there are indeed people that are too paranoid or hateful or whatever, and misunderstand a tap on the shoulder or a bump on a crowded bus, and make false accusations.  But in this modern world you also can't go around ""playfully"" smacking asses.  It's fine if someone asks, or if your partner likes it; or otherwise, depending on the situation.  But if you do start smacking people on the ass for fun, and they accuse you of sexual harassment, then guess what?  They obviously didn't think it was funny, meaning you overstepped your boundaries, and did something wrong.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.793

I really can't. 

We don't do anything positive anymore. We only lead the world in negative things, like mass shootings, rape, teen pregnancy, crime statistics, homicide, etc. We've got kids who are having sex at ages as young as 6, people who go on mass shootings every day, drunk college girls getting raped by the bushel, the highest rates of drug abuse on Earth, a nation of people who make the Stone Ages look smart, groups that advocate for legalised pedophilia, Hollywood rape scandals every day, men in white hoods, women in green armpits, people who kill their friends over X-Boxes, children who kill their own parents, and more. Every day, you hear of some serial killer, or cannibal, or gang shooting, or school massacre, or some new drug that is ravaging the streets, or some racial hate crime. It never ends. Other countries aren't like this. For any list of which country leads the world in something horrible, the US is always at the top or in the top 10. 

And I've never been able to figure out WHY America is so f*cked up. It isn't as conservative as most of the world, and yet it isn't as liberal as Europe. It doesn't have legalised drugs like the Netherlands, and yet it doesn't behead drug dealers like Saudi. It doesn't have legalised prostitution like Germany, and yet it doesn't ban premarital sex like Iran. It is less religious than most of the world, and yet less religious than Europe. It has more lenient gun laws than most of the world, but stricter gun laws than Pakistan, Iraq, and Yemen. It has stricter porn laws than most of Europe, and yet it somehow produces the most porn in the world. So none of those things can be the reason why America is so f*cked up and twisted.

 The only reason why they sided with him is because the right attacked Weiner. TYT also defended Hillary after being caught receiving bribes from the Russian government in exchange with uranium. They will defend ANYONE as long as the people attacking that person are republicans.
Trump is not a conservative and conservatives were not pro-Trump, they were anti-Clinton. Literally none of these things are worse than what Bill Clinton did. Or even what Hillary did. Hillary's email server was illegal and she committed multiple crimes related to classified information. This is a fact not up to debate.

Feel free to provide evidence retard. All I said is 100% true and TYT's youtube channel proves it. Don't you remember Hillary's uranium scandal? They didn't even make a video on it. They commented on the scandal because Trump said something about it. The video that was supposed to cover it ended up being a video about whether Trump's comments were accurate or not. It ended up being nothing but damage control.
