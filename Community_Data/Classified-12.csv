UgzEaaM_rIzJ1oyWs394AaABAg,Segev Stormlord,1 month ago,1512430205960,"...godlings, Adam, ""nationally mandated"" is the only way to do it ""right?"" You're really not doing anybody any favors with that kind of propaganda. If you have national mandates on food labeling, how long do you think it will be before your Hulko company will be ensuring their cronies are on the regulatory boards, mandating the dating to be exactly what Hulko thinks is optimal for THEM? It will ensure that those who actually do a better job of making longer-lasting foods (or foods that taste better longer) get labeled with Hulko's preferred dates. And, if the rhetoric you're using to push for these nationally mandated dates is echoed loudly enough, they'll justify insisting that their competitors' products that are actually not as tasty if not turned over faster ALSO must be dated at Hulko's preferred date.

What you're doing - informing consumers of what the dates actually mean - is half of the solution already. We don't need mandated anything. What we do need is educated consumers who know how to check for spoilage. 

Furthermore, throwing out all that food? Not a ""crisis"" of any sort. Well, except for the fact that the very people who back things like national mandates and federally-commanded welfare demagogue it if food past it's ""best by"" dates is donated. If anything, it means food is very cheap and affordable, since those ""millions of Americans"" aren't all the wicked, evil 1% that are always villified as hoarding resources. The only reason there ARE hunger problems in the world has nothing to do with Capitalist countries wasting food, and everything to do with non-Capitalist countries being led by people who will steal the food donated to their people, as well as anything their people make, and not allow their people to have enough.

Resource scarcity is really a poor resource distribution system. Capitalism is the best resource-distribution system known to man. Where it's in effect, resources are distributed so efficiently that we CAN waste them, because the effort to hoard and shepherd them costs more than the waste. If we distributed Capitalism more evenly around the world, there wouldn't be nation-wide hunger epidemics. There would still be poor people, and still be starving people, but they would be far fewer and farther between world-wide.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.906

UgxBL5Tzk9II12aoXF14AaABAg,SheffieldsPark,1 month ago,1512430220308,"Not exactly true.  Pasteurization just kills bacteria present at the time of bottling.  Bacteria can still contaminate milk after it's been opened, but refrigeration slows their ability to reproduce and metabolize properly.  Given enough time (especially at room temperature), lactobacilli and different fungi can populate a milk jug and speed up the reaction of spoiling to the point that the emulsion becomes acidic enough to eat through the milk container.  Normally, they're at low enough concentrations that they can't hurt you, but the expiration date is effectively the point where the food company can no longer guarantee the quality or safety of their food products when refrigerated properly.  And the molds or lactobacilli can still make you very, very sick.  And this can happen even when the jug is refrigerated, if you give it enough time after the expiration date.  At some point, enough methane and CO2 builds up in the container, trapping more of the heat inside of the jug, speeding up the metabolism of the bacteria and fungal contaminants inside.  The emulsion again can become acidic enough to eat through plastic or paper containers, allowing these contaminants to spread to other items in the fridge.  So, it can make you sick, and pasteurization can only protect you for as long as the container hasn't been opened and been kept outside of optimum refrigeration temperatures.  A couple days or maybe even a week outside the expiration date probably won't hurt you with regards to milk, but two or three weeks just might, especially if it's spent any time sitting out.

UK didnt want it so it wanted to help from US which rejected, but US was fighting against communism at the time so UK used it as an excuse and told US Iran secular goverment wants to implement socialism. US didnt want them to spread it sonce it was a critical politic point so it overthrown the uncontrolable democracy and replaced it with UK and US controlled Monarch and armed the Islamic ""rebel"" groups. Pushed theology in order to prevent spread of communism. Which in 1979 Islamic goverment took the full control spreading the regime to neighbour countries. But after communism threat is gone rebel groups used the hate against America and blamed it for destruction of the area. So this is where ""Us created Islamic terrorism"" comes from because it did in order to fight with communism.

American capitalism is one of the worst forms of capitalism since its pure corparitism what you mention is standart model of capital market without taxes, monopoolies, duopolies, consumer paterns. Only reason big corporations to go full control over everything like other regimes is actually the goverment involment. In American capitalism if you have a cow you have a common virtual value of the cow which conpletely changes depending o n people who want cow or milk, you sell milk to people who have other typr of cow and he pays with different type of milk but since that persons milk is more demand more people with cows buy their milk than they do yours which he gets more cow from all the milk he is getting which also makes more milk. He boughts other peoples different kind of cows which gives him more people to sell their milk which give them more milk to buy more cows. Since that person already have huge amount of cows and every type people know him and buy  from him instead of your cow which this leaves you no choice but to sell your cow and milk cows for him so you can get milks to get different type of milk you want but since now he basically controls the virtual value of cows and milk he can sell you 5 milks on price of 10 milks and you cant do anything about it because you cant compete with it. Thats why in real world 1% gap gets bigger and bigger rich gets richer while moddle and low classes gets poorer and poorer over time.

UgzeBDpVbpw8-ZhzLVN4AaABAg,M cronix,1 month ago,1512430250091,"Animal milk has long been claimed as the go-to source of calcium by the dairy industry, but as it turns out, milk is bad for you. Calcium from animal milk is not absorbed as well as that from plant-based sources, and it can be accompanied by a number of dangerous health problems.
1. Broken bones
In a Swedish medical study, women who consumed large quantities of dairy milk daily were more likely to sustain fractures than those who drank little to no milk. 
2. Prostate cancer
Some evidence suggests that the consumption of milk and other dairy products leads to an increased risk of prostate cancer. Conversely, dairy-free diets have been followed to slow the progress of prostate cancer.
3. Lactose intolerance
Cow‚Äôs milk contains a sugar called lactose that can be difficult for people to digest, resulting in symptoms such as nausea, cramps, gas, bloating, and diarrhea. It can also develop later in life and result in months of worsening symptoms.
4. Acne
In multiple studies, the consumption of all types of cow‚Äôs milk was linked to an increased prevalence and severity of acne in both boys and girls.
5. Cholesterol
A single serving of milk can contain as much as 24 mg of cholesterol, whereas vegan food has no cholesterol.
6. Ovarian cancer
A Swedish study showed that women who consumed four or more servings of dairy products each day were twice as likely to develop serous ovarian cancer as those who consumed two or fewer servings of dairy products each day.
7. Milk allergies
Unlike lactose intolerance, milk allergies, usually in young children, are characterized by potentially strong and dangerous reactions, such as vomiting or anaphylaxis.
8. Antibiotics
Many cows are pumped full of antibiotics. This practice is leading to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which may decrease the effectiveness of antibiotics used on humans.
9. Saturated fat
A single serving of whole milk can contain more than 20 percent of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of saturated fat, but even 1 percent milk has 8 percent of the RDA. If you consume three servings of whole milk, you‚Äôre already at 60 percent for the day, even before eating any food.
10. Weight gain
Despite industry claims, a study of more than 12,000 children showed that the more milk they drank, the more weight they gained, and skim and 1 percent milk appeared, counter-intuitively, to lead to more weight gain than drinking 2 percent or whole milk. The study also found that replacing soda with milk did not lead to weight loss.
11. Bone loss
Instead of promoting bone health, animal protein in dairy products can have a calcium-leaching effect.

These health factors, combined with the environmentally damaging nature of large-scale milk production, make it clear that milk is bad for you.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Positive/,Positive,0.533

""Ham is gross""

""I love dogs""
""Dogs are annoying""

""I find Mila Kunis unattractive""

The only part I could read was the beginning In which you say there is simply to much to know, therefore my statement says everyone is stupid. While i agree with you there is simply to much to know and not enough time to learn it all, that does not apply. I'm not saying absence of the truth or believing in false information makes you stupid, rather ignorance to find or believe the truth when presented. Any ""smart"" person would see something like this video and contemplate if they are part of the problem, but that's not what the majority of people do. When I say ignorance of the truth, I mean that the truth is readily available, but ignored anyway. People that do this don't deserve the title of smart, because they are not willing to alter there belief system, and go through life blind to much of the truth presented to them (ie. ignoring anything that makes them feel bad/ threatens there beliefs)

Take for example god, if undisputed evidence that god was real (or fake, doesn't really matter for this example) was found, anyone that refused to believe this evidence is ignorant of the truth, and will continue there life believing false information.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Let's start with all good things , Spiderman homecoming Is an awesome movie with great battle sequences and gives a new and fresh turn for Peter Parker the fact that it is part of the mcu it shows Spiderman tying in with Tony stank who underestimate a true hero, underoos ,  until the ending.  Through this movie we see a simple and interesting relation Peter has with his friends and his only family aunt may,  being a superhero ain't easy especially when you're in the  badass mcu. This movie has the advantage of making high school and action work as a comedy. Peter has trustworthy friends in world of puberty, parental limits and full time parties. Looks like Peter does enjoy kicking butt and liking gir...scool, school. The vulture the most waited enemy since 2009 but never failed and nailing the role. Plottwist, p*** references, and characters no one gives a sh**        about fills the movie. with the help of his friends, tech nerds,  people who takes l''s on tests and bullies who somewhat care for him. Things just never get old when you like to see the webhead on screen. Okay Now for the good part,  the sins, not always heroes have success, if only we knew what goes behind the mind of this movie maker, hmm seems like Spiderman is not the only one going through this,  Spiderman(green goblin plane nearly killed Peter) is just as homecoming( where vulture nearly killed spidey) (you know that backflip) . #2 (Spiderman 2)train scene and boat scene , tries to pull with the webs but still fails to stop. #3 (Spiderman 3) the sandman chasing scene and (homecoming) the chocker chasing scene looks like enemies have something in common. #4 ( the amazing spider man ) peter from homecoming wears a similar jacket to the one Andrew Garfield used and still wears it in the middle of summer and no one ever bothers to ask him why he is in such a hurry in the middle of new york,. #5 ( the amazing spider man 2) clock tower scene  and homecoming Washington DC elevator scene where Peter safes the girl, looks like planet of the apes rebooting till they get the right script. #6 homecoming Peter romance is basically Andrew Garfield in love with Mary Jane only she's African American , #7 that plane scene from homecoming, ohh. it was inspired by the one from TASM2 how dumb of me . #8 the ending of the battle(homecoming) Peter waits till happy sees him then swings away just Exactly from Spiderman2, just not with the love of his life, #9  on a extended scene,  spidey fights shocker with the mask put on but the same director decided to cut it because it look justlike black Spiderman fighting the sandman, jeez thanks for the reminder. #10 boatscene remindsme of what happened in age of ultron?. #11 Spiderman story is another way to say""iron man and iron man3 "" mixed together with a bit of anchorman, kinda seems like a dejavu. Presentdaymovies have  nothing new,  just a marvel thing, recycling ideas but still covering it with a different plot.  Silly marvel, beats come with cheats #11 1/2. This movie  could done more, way to go for a low budget director. . But like they say,  if it's better than the last knight it gotta be good.                             Hope you like this review and please watch this movie it's good,  hopefully they improve the sequel , if you enjoyed this just leave a comment or give a like.",0,false,0,,,,,,,/Positive/,Positive,0.826

Adam over exaggerates small things like this to make it sound crazy. Like what is wrong with a meat company trelling you when it tastes the best.

While sure it does help them sell more, the legal liability if they don't do it is so much worse than you waiting 4 more days to buy your new meat. No they wouldnt magically go bad in a day but imagine if someone bought 5 of whatever meat they wanted (with adequate refrigeration and stuff) until their expiration date and 1 of them was bad before the date. Its a good way to make people never want to buy your product. So they add a cushion of time to where they know that 99.99 percent of the time the meat will be good for that long. it's not to trick people into getting rid of it. it just happens that there are people that are stupidly religious about the dates so they throw out good food.",1,/Negative/,Negative,0.984

If you don't prepare it properly before consumption, you may end up with food poisoning, and you would get sick if it has been contaminated with bacteria. 

The date however is simply a guideline for ""best served"" so you should look at the texture of the food and look for any signs that the food has been spoiled. If there are no signs of spoilage then you can't get sick from the food unless you have an allergy, intolerance, really dislike the taste, consume too much of something, mix things that don't work together.

All that food being thrown out by grocery stores amd restaurants could just be given to starving people right? Nope. See they get reimbursements for that shit but to do so that have to trash it. Also depending on where are there may be actual laws prohibiting this. For example I live up in Canada. Great place to be, if your not homeless. The city I live in is super fucked. See back in the 90's the cafe chain called Tim Horton's, its a big deal here for some reason, use to give their old backed goods to honelesa people at the end of the day. The food was still good but they couldn't sell it so why not. Well the big rich fat guys didn't like this so they made a policy prohibiting this. And of course stores did it anyway. And now because of this there is a law saying they can't. Or how about clpthes that can't be sold. Like winter jackets. They can be donated to homeless shelters or given to poor families right? Nope. Because again if they do that then the store doesn't get reimbursed for their loses. Instead they take a knife to the jackets and cut them up to the point that they are not useable. Then throw them into a dumpster that gets locked up. Yup super fucked up right? Nope. Because its not really the stores fault. Many places loose thousands of dollars every year on bad merchandise and if they can't recoup their loses they would go bankrupt. So they wouldn't be able to help anyone then and whats worse is you would have more people out of jobs, less affordable products, and less money into the economy. So who's actually to blame? Well partly the corporate branches of these stores for refusing to reimburse them for loses that were donated and partly the government for not stepping in and putting a stop to this shit and for passing laws that make shit harder.

The only problem with the medical system is that there are underlying problems that lead to drug addiction and crippling medical debts. It's not the medical system's fault.

Not saying you're wrong. Just pointing out how you might as well have said nothing at all because there's no value in that statement. Talk about the underlying problems and possible solutions if there are any. To your original point, there are no solutions to big government being corrupted.

First...the sell by date is not the same as the use by date, hence the words ""sell by"" its for the store to make sure they're not selling product that goes bad right after its purchased. Depending on the food, that item should be good for days to even weeks by the sell by date. Second...yes milk is homogenized but that doesn't mean milk is safe to drink forever and ever. The reason milk spoils is because bacteria begins to form in the milk after a certain time. It's also not good to drink milk pass the date even if it smells good because there is still bacteria that has formed in the milk, it just hasn't caused it to spoil yet. To say that you can drink milk pass the sell by and never get sick is completely assanign. You think if you kept milk around for a year and drank it you would have no chance of getting sick? Come on. Plus; why on earth would you ever drink spoiled milk anyway? As far as the chips go with the best by a certain time is because chips have a long shelf life when kept hermetically sealed and that date is a mere suggestion to eat around that time so the manufacturer can garuntee its freshness. On the off chance you keep your chips a long time and they're a bit stail. The date even implies ""best by"" this date just as ""use by"" implies use up to this date only.

Let the power grid be hit by a REAL cyberattack or a powerful blast from the sun and we'll all be looking in all the dumpsters for food for the first couple days of the outage and THEN - no food at all for anyone because there won't be no gas, no ATM's, no electricity, no phones and no trucks to deliver any food anywhere. This kind of major power grid outage won't last for only days or weeks but most likely it will go on for months.

That's WHY I answered the way I did BECAUSE how do you really save and properly distribute the food you save at home? It's also been said that IF we could eliminate all this waste then there would actually be enough food to feed everyone in the world. What I feel is the much bigger problem in food waste is the huge amount of food that grocery stores continue to throw out, and this I've had real experience in dealing with the last four years as I have a food ministry for the homeless. I prepare 40 snack bags a week with a cold drink, a snack mix, yogurt, candy bar, etc, and I distribute these bags to homeless people outside a homeless shelter in Dallas. And guess what? I don't pay one dime for any of this food. It's food that I salvage from dumpsters near where I live. All this food is packaged and safe to eat as I know all about how to handle this food safely with refrigeration, etc. So, this is the food that could easily be saved and given to homeless shelters, churches or distributed directly to homeless souls as I do with most of what I salvage. Believe me, this grocery store waste is sickening. For example A couple years ago I actually found 3,000 full-size Baby Ruth candy bars expired by a mere two weeks in sealed cases alongside a dumpster on a loading dock of a grocery store. Had I not salvaged all these candy bars in the middle of the night they were destined for the landfill the following day. I gave 2,000 to a food pantry and the remaining 1,000 I distribured myself to homeless people near various shelters. Therefore, gorcery store waste is a major source of waste food that could be fed to hungry people in your own city.",9,/Negative/,Negative,0.926

Any food company would supply these countries if their products are purchased.  What you guys are discussing is charity, charity is only ever done by companies as a form of advertisment, meaning if more food was in supply, the amount of charity would not increase as a result, donations are a money game like anything else.  what most likely would happen if people didn't waste as much food is that the cost of food would go down in the local market due to a changed supply/demand ratio.  This lower cost may help poorer countries access the foods, but this would change the supply/demand ratio again bringing the price of food back out of reach, so really the price saving would be localized to existing markets.  In short, the starving people will still starve, the price of our food would go down.",5,/Negative/,Negative,0.988

As of one year ago, a law was passed in France forbidding any grocery store in France from throwing out any so-called expired food. This food can no longer go in the dumpster unless it's really spoiled. Rather the stores are obligated by law to give this food to 501non-profits or to churches for distribution to needy people. If they don't they receive major fines and after three fines they will be going to jail.. And some states in this country have recently passed similar laws so in the not too distance future a lot of this foolish waste will be eliminated.

Also, most shelters either have to or feel the need to throw out expired products donated to them because they're distributing it to other people.

Also, depending on where you are, there might be more local regulations that require stores to not sell expired product.

Also, the consumer has been trained so well that they wouldn't buy expired product even if it was sold for the most part.

Also, those that would ask for a discount. Often, the grocery store loses money on giving the discounts that people ask for on these products because the alternative, claiming them as a loss and bad product and throwing them out, often actually gets the store more of its money back.

'Best Before' legally means that the food is expected to not taste its best after this date but that the food will remain safe to eat for a long period of time afterwards in which it's expected that the product would reasonably be assumed to have been eaten before this period runs out.

'Use By' legally means that the product is expected to not be safe to consume after this date.  There are many ways in which this can legally be determined.  The best method is controlled, scientific tests at recommended temperatures and storage to see when the contamination of the food with bacteria reaches what is considered unsafe levels.  Smaller manufactures just usually look at other similar products and then err on the side of caution so as to not get fined and/or sued for being wrong.  Funnily enough it's the larger manufactures which tend to have longer 'Use By' dates.

One thing I didn't like about the video is how he quickly went past the ""look for signs of food being off"". Expiry dates are put in place so that people don't get sick obviously, however the companies have to put the date a few weeks before the actual date to be on the safe side. 

Lets take eggs for example, mine have a use by of ""15 nov"", I could throw them out cause well it's unsafe now, but I know for a fact that an easy way to tell if they are gone off or not us by doing the water in bowl test. Literally just fill a bowl with water and put the eggs inside it. if it floats its gone off, if its standing its not fully safe, best to boil it, if it is just sitting at the base it is fine. 


Some of mine were not floating, but barely standing, while one was just at the base.

Those are the dates where it's no longer easy to predict under reasonable assumptions that the food will still be safe to consume. They are also chosen based on chemical processes that occur within the food. Milk is a great example of this since it has a nice wide variety of chemical processes by which it transforms into other chemicals which we would not consider milk but may consider cheese curds or any number of things. It's not an exact date like Adam states. It's just an estimate.

As most of us know, proper storage can greatly extend those dates. The store I worked at in the past, which was a well known and respected franchise store would even answer any questions about storage customers may have.

We had some breakfast the next morning including cereal and milk. We kept the leftover milk in the fridge in the middle school/ high school room. It eventually expired but we all decided we were going to keep it as an experiment to see how bad it could get. We kept that gallon of milk in that fridge for two years and then my friend and I decided to challenge ourselves to smell it. When we opened the cap we could already smell it but we still went ahead and put our noses over it and took a big sniff of it and were immediately gagging. The milk stayed in the fridge for another year or two then the youth pastor moved and the new one threw the milk away.

Best Before dates describe when the food tastes best/is best quality but is still safe to eat afterwards.
Use By dates are based on the average amount of time it takes the bacteria in the food to build to an unsafe level or for the food to turn, and is usually dated a little before the shortest time it goes off under normal storage conditions so it can be fine past the date but you want to be careful.

The only exception is with tinned foods or dry foods which don't spoil, as the UK government gives a maximum shelf life for any product.

For the economy, it is no good because you already had food that you threw away thinking it was expired. You would have instead spent that  money on something more desirable to make lives better for you and other people. To explain it better, let's assume that in order to help economy every person starts buying food and then throw it away immediately to buy more to help economy. Let's assume everyone keeps doing it until they run out of money and then go earn more money and repeat the same. Now what will happen is that everyone in the world will be making food as that will be the only job 
 highly in demand. Everyone will be buying food, eating some food and throwing away rest of the food to create jobs for themselves. That deteriorates quality of life for everyone.

That means you have to dedicate at least 100$ a week. If you have a tight budget that means you can't save up as much money as you would like.

When in reality it can be 100$ every 2 weeks. giving you an extra 100$ every other week of saving/spending on something that you would probably need. Examples like these actually hurt other businesses because money can be tight for quite the amount of people, and that's why a lot of people shop in discount stores having even more shady deals like this. Meaning those stores actually take away business from other stores, whether it's the house market(maybe someone needs like 5k-10k extra to buy their dream house) car market, you get the idea. 

Because people are pretty much ignorant to some facts like these or forced because of intentional product tampering it's kind of fucked that companies do that to people who don't know any better or don't have the time to research a lot about it. It's bad for people and other businesses.

One shop I worked in wouldn't sell anything past any date at all, while another could sell certain items for up to a month past the ""best before"" date.

Best bit is, we're almost all taught what those dates actually mean, and that they're largely arbitrary, but we still have to just throw out stock anyway and it's so stupid. We know the system sucks, and when customers ask about it we're allowed to be completely honest about that fact (I've been known to step in and say ""it's reduced to half-price because of the date on it, but it should be all right for another week or two if you store it properly"" on multiple occasions). It seems to help a bit, but we're still throwing out food that's perfectly fine except for the date on it.

They found, producers overshoot with these dates, and somene medicine was just as good months after it's expired date. Other drugs, like antibiotics just lose their potency slowly, so that if you, for example, live in dire times when no new drugs available (eg., war), you just take an increased dose depending on how expired the drug is, and you are good.

Yogurt can still be good for 2 weeks after the date.
Juice can go up to a month if you don't mind the slight change in taste.
Veggies and Fruits, well, if you can't figure out if they are still good or bad, you need glasses...
Cans last forever, unless they are poorly stored and have rust on them.
Bread generally last about a week extra, more if you keep it in the fridge and not on your counter, same with baked desserts.
Dry stuff like cereals, granola bars and other boxed snacks that are in a ""sealed"" kind of bag also last for weeks, if not months.
Best By dates truly, are a lie.
The best way to know if something if bad.

UgwciBGLqajtgu8Xjqh4AaABAg,thequantumstring,1 month ago,1512430442195,"Bacteria in Milk

Most types of bacteria are killed by heat when milk is pasteurized. It‚Äôs possible for milk to become contaminated after it‚Äôs pasteurized, but even under clean conditions, some sneaky bacterial spores survive processing. Not only that, but they also grow under cold temperatures, so refrigeration slows them down but doesn‚Äôt stop them. These thermoduric bacteria are the ones usually responsible for milk spoilage beyond the expiration date on the carton. Several different types of thermoduric bacteria exist. The extent of the spoilage depends on the specific bacteria

Food Poisoning

If you drink milk past the expiration date, you run the risk of developing food poisoning from unhealthy bacteria that might have grown in the milk. Food poisoning can be so mild you might not even realize you have it, but it can be severe in some cases. You might develop stomach cramps, nausea, diarrhea or a fever. It can last for hours or days, and you might start to feel the effects of the bad milk within a couple hours of drinking it. Since raw milk isn‚Äôt pasteurized, it has a better chance of containing bacteria and can cause serious illness, especially for anyone with a compromised immune system.",1,false,0,,,,,,,/Negative/,Negative,0.697

Most people, I believe, are smart, and wouldn't blindly waste food (unlike the caricatures shown in the video).

Additionally, and without sounding like a corporate lackey or something, the reason corporations don't want to give a less-fresh product to their consumers isn't because they want people to buy more of the product after throwing away the ""spoiled"" stuff, they would rather consumers not have a negative experience with the product.

This includes the 'mince pie on Christmas ban', 'the Vicar must train the men of the village in archery every Sunday', and even all those 'shooting a Welshman with a crossbow in the bounds of York' laws. Not even every law that is legally enforcable is enforced.

Onto my favourite British law, the legal drinking age. There's a variety and there's a decent argument for it causing a better drinking culture, but at least in England a newborn baby can be given alcohol if prescribed by a doctor. the legal age for supervised drink on a private premise is five with your parent's permission, this is generally used to allow kids to join in the New Year cheers in my experience with a single glass. You can legally order some forms of alcohol with a meal once you reach 16 (I personally did at that age), and from 18 onwards you can buy and drink whatever you want. There's actual logic in a slow introduction to alcohol, most people I know who had one went off to university and rarely drunk.",0,/Positive/,Positive,0.516

Now, I personally have no issue with that as it only paints the opposition as a bunch of idiotic dunces who hate intelligence and their opinions being argued by actual facts.

There is no political agenda to Adam's show, rather it's to educate people on misconceptions and widely believed half/non-truths or other beliefs that aren't based in reality.

And this isn't scraping the bottom of the barrel, this just another topic that happens to be believed by many people at some point in their lives. Just because some people like myself, or you, know this information to be correct already, doesn't mean everyone knows it. Because again, it's about proving misconceptions and beliefs previously thought to be true wrong. 

All you've proved in your statement trying to politicize this show is that the right is currently waging war against educated and open minded people.

But you're technically right that he is liberal in the educational sense, as being defined as:

(of education)concerned mainly with broadening a person's general knowledge and experience, rather than with technical or professional training.

And the viewers would also be liberal by definition as:

open to new behavior or opinions and willing to discard traditional thoughts and values. (Especially faced with new information that contradicts previous held beliefs).

So that's bad... How?

Oh, and you obviously don't know the definition of ""propaganda"" either. As this as well as any of his shows aren't propaganda by any means.",0,/Negative/,Negative,0.797
