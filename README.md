# Data collection
Data were collected from top 3 political channels with comment section enabled (TYT, CNN and BBC news) and top 3 comedy channels (CollegeHumor, Annoying Orange, and PowerfulJRE). 23 video communities were selected with a history of a month, more than 1000 comments and the videos need to be last about 4 to 10 minutes to provide adequate information for potential discussions. 

# Identify trolling message
Trolling messages will be identified from all comments about the videos, using vulgarity list, second person pronoun and the sentiment (Al-garadi et al., 2016; Squicciarini et al., 2015). 
In addition, vulgarity word list is collected from several online bad word lists (banbuilder.com, bannedwordlist.com, noswearing.com and urbanoalvarez.es) which contain offend words and cursing words used by native English speakers in social media (Wang, Chen, Thirunarayan, & Sheth, 2014). 

# Pre-troll network construction 
Pre-troll networks were contructed from each community (video) for the first 5 trolls in the communities, pre-troll networks for the later trolls of the first 5 included the pretroll networks for the earlier trolls. The entire interactions involving deleted comments were removed from the networks.
